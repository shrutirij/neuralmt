it 's tedious .
my mom moved up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my own life , as we do it , it does n't have that gerochen dinosaurs .
i 'm kurban und and jahre years old .
fifteen years ago , i was with my mom and my brother from china to germany .
now , from that basis , i tell you today .
but most importantly , i 'm going to tell you the people who have this tendency and made a success .
but first of all , i tell you where i come from .
i am . .
sind are a small , that lives in the realm of china .
and this region is called the gebiet area .
it 's about kilometer miles away .
in china , in china , a number of 10 million of the world 's largest community is outside in china .
and this leben life is because we have to suffer in china .
hundreds of thousands of chinese have gone down to how we 'd become in our own home .
our own language , wurde became dem from the education system .
in schools and in universities , only chinese conversations .
and our religion , we need to be free .
they 're losing their culture and identity .
and if someone is living , and for the right is that , for the right , for the most of the cost of life , has been used for a long time or death .
it was also the reason that my parents decided for me to . us .
that was und and i was 11 years old .
the picture is a very short time ago .
we did n't have enough money , so my father had to leave me .
i 'm looking at a lot of people who have helped us who have been helped us .
i 'm looking at a lot of images .
i 'm very an to unseren on our schlepper .
i kind of give him exactly what my eyes are .
he was a big lederjacke , always , and we made him with his little auf on a reef .
the first is . .
i know a lot of a negative picture of people who have just do business do n't want to do business , they do n't really care about it .
but i 'm sorry to say , `` i want to call him as nennen , '' not as a . .
because they get rid of us crying .
he stood down at the airport in auf on a und , and it was until to the last end , whether we were really safe by the kamen .
and we came there and i know what my mother looks like to me , just out of the airport .
do n't .
until we get out of it
because i had a walk in my hand , and i was there in my photograph , but i was a close name , . .
i had to do like durch through . .
and i ' to give me a zollbeamten der of what he had to do in my hand .
silence .

a long one .
we finally durchgewunken .
in argentina , ' , i was looking at a lot of people who were kind of haben .
i ' to the frau woman who used with us in a hospital .
it 's in a mit with four pro per dreizehn families .
at least three children .
a und and a kitchen .
there was 600 faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mom , my brother and i had to share a teilen .
there were eaten , dick and chicken .
and my friends were n't going to go up because i was , , where we found .
it 's just my favorite der of the in in wusste .
she knew my story and she made me a lot , and she managed to me .
for example , they brought me to sportgymnastik what i do n't do .
but she also helped me , kind of , mitschüler kennenzulernen kennenzulernen .
i spent my whole interview in . .
this was not easy for my mom .
in fact , with children without their husband , and always in the process because we had only had a und , and they could be accepted .
i was ' myself that i really was very , very war .
it 's a little bit embarrassing to tell you , but now i 'll just stand to my story .
i was very privileged , and i was very interested in school .
we 've got that first to erziehungshilfe wo where we had the first time in normal children .
i do n't know if i was a children who did n't have to live in a wohnen .
i was also ' to the die that i have , and my brother sent up to be oder or geschickt .
only of that we get a little bit out of
i was also ' by multiple mitarbeiterinnen who have made us cold because our parents could n't have a heart attack .
or they just came out with us .
we 've always been surprised .
and i know how we went from the corner and waiting for these people , because , somehow , strangers took people for the time , and that was important to us .
after two years , my father finally came to germany .
but the problem was that he was von von by nach because it had n't had a place for him .
i was ' myself , very , very smooth , who managed to protect my father from nach to china , and it even came to us that he had to live with us .
i 'm ' myself at this time where i really was very , very happy because after six years ago , we had to move into a normal plane .
we got a für for three years , and we ended up a personal ship with one of his arms and one of her .
and i even had a room .
it was a very small and i did n't have home in , but it was good , i could fall my door .
and i ' , i mean , i did n't have that time , very well , but i had to leave the ohne without a verlassen .
i do n't really looked for a perspective .
there came to be a , , that i was going to put in immer , and it 's still going to work to the idea that i could get over the second meine program .
first of all , they called the . .
thank you for my teachers who believed me , and i was really not going to get into the time that i did n't get into the middle of the middle .
after that i came to . .
and before i was a kam , i was playing by my best friend bei .
ist is a organization or a project of organized straßenfußballs .
but i was n't a good thing to do that , and i 've just done because we had a place in which we could just go .
we had a bowl of what we could be able to konnten our rauslassen .
and the head of half taught us that we were able to tell our problems , and he went to us and could be a sort of . us .
and then i came to , , . .
and this is a project where young people are asked to get a chance to get weiterzubilden .
that was really , really well , and i realized , art is something that really runterbringt me .
through und and respect , a commodity came on us .
he made the film über about the life of my friends and me .
and the film won many walls .
we found that people were interested in for our history .
he was a very special sense because we had never seen people to have heard of us .
and that was a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to get anymore .
i want to make something out of my life .
a von of , , a für for cuba came on me for the idea of a von of the kammerspielen mitzumachen .
but since i was in the horizontal building , i ended up with a für , and the title is eins one to four .
so i was exactly right .
i was playing .
and the great thing is that , after a performance , two vom are bayrischen mich .
and i had asked if i could have been able to have any zu .
i thought , great , . .
i 'm sorry .
and i made up for the on-drei-radio , , and now radiobeiträge und and one of my pieces of a play , , where i was in the european . for the european of the european .
and i actually won him .
now i 'm looking at college college , and film dokumentarfilmregie , in the third year and is der in the third year .
and this is not possible for me to do not like either , or organizations like oder or projects for me .
they 've believed to me , they made me open spaces , they showed me how i can kann my place in society .
and that 's where i come to you .
each of them has the ability to get people like me to help second opportunity and to find their lives or their place in society .
because , the people , at least , have to come up with a hundred inches to indonesia , and each of them are full of hope and each of them have a huge potential .
they 've made a lot of terrible geschafft behind them .
and with this circle , they could really be large für for germany and for every single one of us .
and i could tell you some of the things that you can do , but i do n't have any more time to do that there , a minute of , , i 've brought you a mitgebracht .
now check your phone phones , and you ca n't tell me that they can make a code .
put out the code , and then you come to the side of mit with lots of ideas you can do .
and this would be really good .
i 've been looking for your engagement now , and we 'll see where i 'm going to see
and watch the code .
i feature .
a lot of them do n't have cell phones .
are you so completely , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
ja .
it 's only a gruß meinerseits .
i 'm sorry that we 're living .
my name is . .
my ist is sich than it talks .
i am coming from jordan , which is in tokyo .
now , i 'm very pleased to have a very , very good thing to be today today .
i 'm going to give you a very simple one .
and that 's not a prediction , this is a feeling .
yeah , yeah , in contrast to the other , i 'm not going to be here to give you about something .
i did n't know what .
but it 's so that i write a little bit of text in my pieces , and this is where i 'm going to talk to the next presentation , mostly at slams oder or oder or events like today .
yeah , and i was asked to be here today , a few ago , to make the whole program a little bit more . .
and that 's exactly what i 'm going to do here .
yeah .
let me start with a joke .
these are two magnets .
so let me give you , you know , two of them , you know , `` well , two of them , '' and `` do n't , , '' but they do n't have , you in in bed in . .
let 's hear .
`` it just is n't about me . ''
here we have this level of . .
the first text is a little , i wrote .
i 've got it at a person who is part of what he does .
it carries the title .
and yeah , she did n't understand it .
when your head was in my hands , my rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my dein 's leg outside the ceiling .
my leg was long with the ceiling .
it 's your head . it 's based on my lap , the rest of you in the ceiling , my leg is also under the ceiling , your leg outside the ceiling .
this is , , when it was in my leg .
it was very . .
the next text i did was i put a person who was a lot .
that 's my . .
we do n't have a chance to do .
my favorite grandfather was metzger . .
already as a child , he brought with love geschnitten .
just so , yeah .
yeah , with text text .
it 's better .
jesus is the only steht on the top of the glass of the bus .
but where was it when he was going to save me in front of that hätt ' ?
are you thinking , yes ?
did i have to do my schon ?
next text .
the next text is a little longer .
he actually takes a hours .
so , to writing writing .
reading goes faster .
it 's the beginning of a novel that i described in the schreib .
ah , it 's about 120 guys , so the youngest of one guy who 's going to come back to the hair and do a little too much . .
i 'm always ' myself at this point that i 'm coming around .
because i never shut up the hair .
chapter one .
if i get wird , my head becomes empty .
so empty like the piece that it 's trying to fill .
yeah , i 'm not there .
very hard for hours .
the next text is a little . .
people do n't understand it .
i do enjoy myself .
and that 's what i 'm going to do , i 'd like to say , `` i 'm like , '' i 'd like to say , `` i 'm like , '' i 'd like
i 've always been playing with myself .
and yeah , there are things like this .
it carries the title .
it 's a little bit strange .
it may be the sprachspiel , , which i 've ever written .
we .
yeah , we . .
let 's see .
we . .
now i 'm going to do something else .
but i can .
i 'm not able to
i do n't .
yeah , i did n't understand it .
no idea .
yeah , yeah , von from me .
i always say , either everyone or no .
the next piece , though , is to do with text .
it 's kind of a small . .
i was writing this at insects .
very low .
yeah , with text text .
is a little . .
and it 's only cool when i 'm going to do that for three say .
my text is den , all the good things are cool .
so what we 've done is , what we 've done is , they 're . .
we is chel . .
so followed , chel , und and und , and then all the better and yes , that was it .
beautiful pieces of time .
yes , mitmachtext , , that 's another one .
and it 's really cool if i do so that we could make all of this kind of machen , so let 's try all the time .
that 's exactly what the wind is doing .
the text is wearing `` und '' and it goes .
yeah .
power is fun .
the average text is just a sentence .
i would like to write a little . .
this is a sexuelles paradox .
goliath is written with s geschrieben .

yeah , yeah .
power is fun .
yeah .
it 's written in geschrieben .
it 's a very long sentence .
i think it 's a bit impossible to explain , to explain rein , that 's the point .
here 's another text .
that day is a . .
the title from the text .
this day is a und , and he knows it .
he already knew it before i have this habe .
he gave me some of his time , then he would lassen me .
i can put myself later into him .
i made the joy .
it und as a vor from any other days , and i was . myself .
with a grinsen im in the face of the face ?
and intent , he no longer to give him by aufwache .
and i was going to conclude again , and it 's not going to have a dancing day .
is hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
now , what would be called a film when he was n't used to him ?
i whistled .
so .
it sounds out to be q sounds like the cow .
that 's the fun thing .
yeah , the next text also has learned the paper .
it 's something political .
so i write not just weird things .
i write very , very political things .
and i 'll often ask where i 'm ' .
and yeah , yeah , i just wrote this text here .
he carries the zu-meiner-herkunft .
my father came from massachusetts , and then my mother and i came out of her .
yeah .
we would have that . .
thank you for sound .
yes , in this point , what i 'd like to do is make a
i ca n't afford business business or so , so i need to do that .
and that 's what i also love for myself , and i also do a slam in .
i love to play .
and yes , i ' , i 'm really sympathisch .
and , yeah .
i just want to say that .
it 's on the program .
more advertising .
that 's a little advertising i wrote .

rich .
so the . .

well , pretty funny .
i want to write a joke about the deiner of your friend , but the prison line was just flat .
yeah , it 's not my . .
you have gärungsprozess you have have have the the out message of it .
yeah .
thank you for listening .
they were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me start with a frage question .
why do you want to run überhaupt at all ?
i mean , anybody who 's used to have money , whether he 's going to have a society of society .
and the answer is clear .
we know now that life is only about prozent percent determiniert .
that means , you need to have some environmental effects , which have access to the influence .
now why do we know so much ?
why is it that , why is it that we 're going to go to the nachrichten of nachrichten messages that makes up part of each other ?
you all remember , 15 years ago , the gefunden process .
it was fat .
and you thought , if you get fat out of food , we 'll all be part and you 'll be healthy .
what has happened to the von of absurden regalen with different in in american arabia , and what has nothing has changed is that the americans have gone every year .
you know , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the low-power .
what happens to wie like the der of the , and the und and so on .
so it 's always going to have a new sau from the village .
how about all of this ? ?
now the reason for me , for my mind , is that we . ansätze anekdotische anekdotische anekdotische zu zu .
so , an example of a einzelfall prison .
the kennen you all know .
veröffentlichte published a lot of zeitschrift wrote a new . .
the top der of todeskandidaten für for the next year .
jennifer edison had been around for seven years .
then they died the newspaper .
or this lady here .

the oldest man who ever lived on earth .
jahre years old .
i know there are people who say they 're six , but they ca n't find their nicht .
it 's a geworden ist .
and she listened to fing auf , but with wieder dem , the path of trying to follow and stop zu .
with ist they died .
so what does this tell us ?
not that gesund are healthy .
but it tells us that strangers is very complicated , and that we need to need to be commercial statistics , and we need to ask simple questions .
it 's a simple question , and it 's a very simple thing to do , that in many countries , women are older than men .
what is this ?
we know it now .
and that 's basically what 's going on in the field of what 's going on in the male .
and there are signs of simple evidence to that , as it turns out , it 's as old as women .
now , everybody can think that this is a anti-aging-weg ist .
calpers is a land country .
but there 's even better news , no fear .
now , we 're going to be able to mit ourselves down with zu .
sounds complicated , but it 's easy to illustrate the normal flow .
so there was somebody who asked oma and wonder about what was they going to do so different or anything else that they were so old ?
court .
the cia has 10 geraucht . every day .
this is probably the secret of your age , right ?
in those words , the ten americans may not have . .
or , `` but they have und , and the advertising would n't get the ten percent .
even the statistics are not always . .
for example , for example , they 've got very hard statistics , which is that people who are going to be older in besuchen are older than people who do n't .
unmistakable .
it 's . .
is that das ? ?
no .
it 's because people are just enough money in your pocket to be good about their age and the erkrankungen conditions .
but if i was to give a group of einen into a food company , and these group have spent 20 percent longer than if they did n't get it right now , but otherwise , in fact , i was actually going to get a faktor factor in the diet .
and in fact , that 's what they 've been done .
you 've got to tell you , the ist is very worin , but even though i 'm aware of my enemies is that fasten are made of life .
and this works for all kinds of organisms .
for example , in bacteria .
you can see there 's von of bacteria .
if we look at the age of the linie line , they have a lot of life .
and the same is true of , , fliegen , and recently , about two years ago in the united states , that it 's even for monkeys .
it 's not about being sweet .
it also works in der of the küche kitchen .
and this is another experiment , which has been done in the united states .
what did you do here ?
you 've got mausgruppe , and you have this kind of high-fat-diet , , a diät diet where you 've got so many hier here and night .
and who 's brilliant , who has become a childhood , sick , and they 've had some terrible gehabt gehabt and bad . .
now , you 've got a very serious number , and that 's exactly the same number of gefüttert to nur only that it was pause .
they were n't going to eat their food , that they 've eaten the day twice .
and these nun now is lower and healthy , and they 're not a . .
even though they were mäuse .
they 've got a lot of food .
one sick and the other healthy .
so what happens ?
it becomes a process called selbstreinigung oder or angeschaltet .
and as soon as they take organisms or cells , then the organism starts to send the organism out of the cell or bestandteile areas to make energy more energy .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
and you can see , in the cell , in the same way in the cell , it 's mostly a common way to , , which is during the age of time .
and the dann then started to dem the maggots and put the cell as energy .
by the way , they 'll put teachers in the age of the age .
this is actually the swiss der of , , or the von of the oft parts .
so , in many ways , it 's regelmäßiges , in many ways .
and it 's probably , to assume that it 's working with people .
and what we 're learning is that they 're not going to fight in empfohlen every little am on the day .
no .
but , you want to tell you , if you have hunger , ah , maybe it 's going to hit the angeschaltet .
claim your hunger as a friend .
and that makes a sinn sense .
during komma , nine nine percent of the human history is the human man , if he was hungry ?
that 's exactly what he is doing .
we 're going to try to buy our hands if we 're hungry .
and that 's certainly against biology .
now , of course , we know , and this is in the bible , in kapitel , sechsundzwanzig , , the mind , and the meat is weak .
the garden looks very different .
here we 've seen from brueghel in in a paradies garden .
it 's really good to the three to the three to the top day .
and that 's kind of the real . .
so we 've got a look looking for granted , which is the molecular response of the anschalten memory era .
it could be interesting for people to be interesting with , their nicht .
and it could be perhaps perhaps one of the wegkreuzungen des of life .
so the question is , we can use the , , the , , the selbstverdau , and when you eat ?
and we have a lot of hundred , a little thousand of them , natural engagement .
we found it in case that the spermidin .
now , ist is a matter that is produced in all organisms , but also in all organisms are less in all organisms .
in the skin , it 's in . .
menschen people have less in in the skin than . .
and if we give auf to human cells , for example , look at that .
this is serious cell here .
it 's the , , and we 're going to give us spermidin , and we 're seeing a lot of thousands of this little in in the cell that 's going to come out of the age of the age .
now , zellen cells would look like this .
and that works in many organisms .
so , for example , here 's a little . .
so we 've seen the gefunden gefunden die die .
life because organisms are too much .
and the answer is , again , you see the typical von of a . .
they 're simple . .
after tagen days , all of the dead people are dead , for example , half dead .
whenever we put ins to the network , they 'll be able to see where animals are older and survive .
we also know that human cells that we have of ex individual gezapft , in culture , about three times as long as we put them together .
and the final research research also , again , is that even the life 's life is going through by the life .
and it 's not just life , it 's also the . .
these are immunkompetenter . .
so .
now , of course , do you want all of us , what 's going on ?
as the name says , it 's been discovered in orbit , it 's in very high levels .
but i can , them , also in frischem , and a product made out of sojabohnen , , which has great genießt , which is , of course , kommt kommt .
and then we told you , when gegen can help hilft , by using the aufräumt hilft , then do n't want to ? ?
what you have to know is that the common divergence of all erkrankungen diseases is that during the age of im in the brain .
and we 've done these experiments .
they 're going to wonder we 've done that .
they 're also , when they 're old .
they have more im in the brain when they 're old .
and the toxic contribution that are involved in memory are very similar to people .
now you ask yourself , how to the devil , what is the guy 's wrong ?
this is the experiment that we 've made together with disease 's von von .
you take a hundred und and you put that up there , and you give a smell that you love .
deworming .
and let 's put it into a aalen .
and then they take the same fly , they give them in the next stages and give them to give them some other points that they love , which is . .
we 'd like to do this genießen while she zuckerbelohnung zuckerbelohnung .

then you take the same fly , and you do that .
you can see the running right here right here .
and if you 've got down here , you give it from one side and from another side .
where do they all go ?
yeah .

except the two ones here .
these are the . .
or , say , you have a character .
i love my und , and i do n't want to do it by the belohnung reward . .
okay .
but also , the form of character that goes with the age of the age .
not just in the fly .
and we actually could , in fact , the der of the fly from auf to a , , to a , , level .
and the , that were made in the brain were . .
it 's not just , , but it 's not just alterung , you know .
and that 's important because we do n't want to reduce the nicht of the living .
it does n't make sense to reduce the time in the time .
and i do n't want to leave you , without giving some of the work that we might be younger .
let 's have a little more time .
it 's not that you get weight .
there are , in austria , von group of leuten people who ate a day and a day .
this is the so-called unter under the line of germany and accountability .
and they hold very well .
that means it 's . .
you can be . .
it 's not about conventional complex tumors in the same way .
it 's really about unbelievable .
you know that hinreichend sind are sind , even if they 're sind .
and you also know that sugar can make growth of tumors .
here you see , wurmpopulation die , vor .
after 30 days , all of them are dead .
very low , dosen .
to create a effekt effect .
there 's only one example that works almost all of these organisms .
eat out disease and vegetables .
avoid the gift of many oder or vitamintabletten .
you know , we know that -- -- and krebs cancer can produce .
this is not among the conditions for vitamin d .
we may be here at the winter center , because vitamin d is created by sunlight on the skin .
some three times three times half 10 hour ago , and that 's hard .
because of the early beispiele examples , they do n't live 10 to 10 years .
do you .
the impact of wonder and pressure on the life is shot .
because venus life is almost as long as women .
, , alkoholtrinker , , live longer than . .
leben lives longer than . .
but they still live longer than . .
only sterben of dying were used as a . .
what is this ?
people think that what happens to do is to do with some
no , no , it 's very simple .
now , if i 'm here today , a am on the window is ' , i 'm mit .
and what happens is , what happens is that happening in your field .
ablagerungen , , und and the way that they 're going to get out of unter under people .
that 's what happens to do in terms of 'ne . .
you have a complicated partner , or you can have familie family .
they should not live in a much straße road .
now you 're going to do a look at you .
but that 's not to do with gar .
it 's lärmbelastung .
you can measure the closer from a much straße street , the more hat he has in blood .
and that 's when he says , i used to make my attention .
i can do good quickly and the noise do n't make me anything .
it 's not .
it has more im in blood and it 's bad .
arabic should be fixed because of course .
we know that sehr sehr has very well very well .
all of a sudden it can increase the senken .
and we also know that we can do this research , and we also know how to protect the schützen .
this knew by the process of our frustration , also , with us and so forth .
not without meaning .
and several studies show that dark chocolate can cause for heart disease .
just recently , a beautiful study has shown that if half of the ice is dark chocolate per day , the eines of one auf could bring the level of a bringen .
now , what you do is , you want to do something like this .
there are studies that show that there are studies that do n't show that .
what 's clear is that it 's going to function coffee against diabetes , and it 's possible to produce its mental performance .
and up , by the way , it 's a very good subject because it creates aus of how we could get together with kroemer aus .
we 've had a very nice time in the hundred people who have been shown for the hundred and a half of people who have been shown to the hundred years of six years .
this is a huge value for conventional research study .
and that 's true for , , pistazien , haselnüsse , macadamia , walnüsse , walnüsse .
but not yet , the gesehen are actually the most successful .
they 're just going to give up their own children , ok ?
but that 's actually true .
so fortunately , this is not .
the next point is a little extreme .
you 're going to avoid the camera from much of the kind of animal protein , so it 's fleisch , it 's only when it 's between und and jahre .
there 's a really nice new study showing that if you 're going to have a lot of animal proteins , you take your so so strong than you were having a huge deal .
it 's not that they 're good at the time where these are these proteins are good , and it 's not for children 's kids or teenagers , the animal proteins , and it 's not for sale and those who want to be .
what they 're doing is , they 're sie .
what they 're doing is , they 've got das , which is , in fact , that they 've said the smell , the , , the misstrauen , the sind of the health .
it 's all gehört right now .
this is the salvatore der der who lived about this block , and he 's got jahre years old .
it comes from my home from my home 's , .
and it 's really good .
he 's not not a einzelfall drop at all , but he lives in a , , where there 's some healthy gibt .
it 's about the gefolgt board that i told you today .
we do n't want to be in all the experimenten experiments that do n't even exist at all .
that is , the des of the mir of my country does not have to be biological , but it 's a . .
you give the old people less , and it may be one of the most vulnerable mistakes of our culture .
schrieb wrote the biggest novel in ein a year ago .
the brothers . .
a piece of work , at the way , vor vor die .
thank you for listening .
so i want to start with a question that i can tell you .
one question , where no one needs to get up , because it 's a little scary thing who is who is evil ?
it 's very small .
less than i thought .
it 's probably not reasons why they do n't have haben , but the people who would have to deal with it as well .
so a lot of people do alleinsein and und and think of that .
that 's not the case .
now , here is actually a phenomenon of a phenomenon in people as alone .
maybe it 's also because they 're not haben because the question is ist .
do you feel secure , or are you agreed ?
you can feel fühlen without zu .
and you can be surprised without feeling zu .
faiza also has a lot to do with it .
now , a few now now , some of us will have haben themselves .
erick leads to und and führt .
mark need time .
so now there 's nobody going here in the few seconds that i gave you .
erick needs . .
insulin uses the time to be aware of her .
and insulin uses also need exercise to talk about that .
and we do n't do this kind of practice .
we do n't have the language yet we have signs for ourselves , so when we have a sense of noise ?
there are two , that i 've ever been sitting on .
the one part of humanity says , you 're from the beginning of memory .
from the birth to death , they 're actually . .
there are few moments in your life where you can .
so these people are often going to und and sich the whole day .
i did n't even have time . it 's your . .
and then there are people less , who say everything is connected to everything .
i do n't really have it , so i 'm just part of the big universe .
and these are the great group that i 've been looking at some of the time ,
the thinking is , okay today , i 'm happy and the next day , oh , it 's all about each other .
if we think about insulin thinking , it turns out to be a big soldier .
the owner of the river , the der of the person on an act .
but beyond these , , these large möcht , i 'm really not talking about , but i want to talk about the small ones that we have about the everyday stages , where obesity can be in a theater .
i do n't want to talk about the indians and the des of the . .
mark in other results , most of us do n't feel very hard to us .
now , the hundreds of astronomers introduced a few pictures i want to show you .
how easily it would always determine in others .
and we all do n't know whether these people really felt false in that moment .
but who knows it does n't know , the moment in this particular event where you think , all talk to each other , only you lose yourself something lost up in the corner .
you know , all of a sudden , you know , you know , you know , you know , these
maybe some of them have already been well .
so what you 're doing is , the mobile phone does a lot of the mobile phone , you could actually see this very well as well as a , , which is a vor on the cell phone .
clearly , if you look at the screen .
what we do n't do here .
yeah , and then there is the abstraction , which is the number of the number of a auf in bühne , hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of people , and you give something out of hope that you do n't forget .
these are the , that you see from the outside .
we are . other people .
but i 'm sure there are people in the room who are looking at some of the things that their whole lives would have made that they 've tried , that von of what they 're trying to do is they 're trying to adapt to them .
and there are also people who are surprised , because they have to feed a different person , it 's because death or because of a sudden .
and it also uses nothing that even so many people , even people , with whom they 're connected to them around them , they feel they feel .
and there are people who are trying to find themselves in terms of themselves .
i ' the digital wing .
and below your hand , you 'll bring the mic out .
the usda is familiar with us .
these are people who believe their opinion in social business .
it 's always relatively .
there is no dumb number , there are no zahl number when someone has given human human hat .
we immediately immediately see the old people .
it 's the informal form of death .
but since that , we all live in cities with a lot of people at facebook or by twitter or facebook , this digital decline has always been bigger .
you can be connected to hundreds of people without having a single person .
it 's a lot to be the von of human relationships , and that 's missing to the digital layer of the relationships .
the two forms of deaths are very often at each other .
and that turns out that mathematicians are a little daherkommt player .
whereas digital prices are good for und and sadness .
it 's that the digital country in the future has to be more powerful than the opportunities to connect , bigger .
i do n't know if you 'll be this feeling in 20 years , that it will be very similar to us .
or whether you find a new term .
but these are also the problems of generation generation .
it 's almost bigger than the fifth self is the fear of the resistance and of that fear being people to do some other things .
, , the large , , also a mensch leader has written a wonderful geschrieben .
in fact , they do what people do all to be not alone .
they 're building , you know , kids that are sind and left .
but what they did n't write was they said to , the fear of the wing , which is money .
gehen go .
things like that .
and the process that we 've seen is because it 's kind of like , at least , it 's kind of einen and the objects that you have chosen .
but the problem is that it 's going to do very well and it 's going to do that this gegen against the . .
that 's why we need to buy some new things .
i saw the advertising company for one of the most unterhosen college college .
and the ganz effect is completely von from mobile phone with the obvious part of it .
now , what that does to do in order is that you do n't know , but apparently it works .
so insulin has n't do anything to do with the zu of one of these things like that .
kästner hat has written a wonderful poem , and there 's a description in the worst side of land .
hand on your heart , who knows that ?
in a relationship or or the other thing , or the other thing , or the other in zu , can suddenly feel terrible and feel terrible and the question is , who 's the person in it ?
did i have something to do with anything ?
one study is that , at all , women are women around who , married and children .
because of course , because i do n't know anymore , if i did n't have the study of the study , i 've done it so often .
but now it 's also not because it 's mostly at least at the studies of research , and the reaction always always is that people mir me .
that the script is so completely , is almost a . .
right ?
let me tell you a little bit little about the history of sex .
well , that 's probably what everybody happened .
still , while you 're ist , suddenly what do i actually do ?
who is this person in my bed ?
also , a form of lentils is not necessarily what you have to do with the quality of your mind .
not nothing to have done with the quality of relationship .
it 's just there .
we do n't talk about them because we do n't see them .
we do n't talk right about them in the workforce .
in the 1990s , the driver is also als as we think .
i was so on so kongresszentrum , and there was a group of five , , better i 'm talking about three anzug , and two kostüm .
the two men have a conversation , the two women who have ever talked about .
and in between britain , something a little bit mit with the in in .
i mean , i do n't have to take you this picture , and you 've got to have this kind of wing that everyone else has already seen in its classroom .
it 's the des of . .
but it 's also the tip of the iceberg .
we all know the oder , or i see here , we may also sit in some of these guys .
in , , in hotels in kenya , which often do n't even know who they 're really , what they 're doing .
where they are .
this is a form of stockholm that 's not talked about .
it 's only that they can be able to be , , as opposed as to be missbraucht .
and i want to say that this is necrophilia .
i 've been told a question to say that he was calling by a customer , and who said it 's what is going on , you ca n't imagine it .
a war was alone in the conference .
it turns out to be freigegeben .
and two months later , he 's shocked .
the electron is never going to be here .
it always comes in with other emotions .
she has beautiful videos , and she has horrible glue .
the ones we know is everybody .
you can be afraid , pure anger and the experience .
but we should not forget the nice hypothesis .
the freedom to the die is the desire for the . .
that 's what i 'm going to look at in terms of interest .
and it goes in life like the dark and it goes .
let 's put them up , and let 's not take it from you .
because there is something much worse than the horizon , and that is the empty , you might have no idea anything .
insulin is part of life .
since i was thinking , i 've been thinking about it for two things .
one in my career , i do n't know anymore , i do n't know , i always call somebody why he did n't have any head because i thought maybe i thought i would have heard the people , maybe i 'm ' .
i 've spent it since , since , since , i 've taken the eggs in my life to come and go forward .
that 's exactly how it 's like the , you do .
again , i have become free .
people come and walk away , they 're not going to be able to check out whether they could have a oder , a oder , or something like that .
as a child , i found incredibly embarrassing .
you can not start with someone 's vorbeigehen without somebody else .
whether in the oder or in the economy .
every time , it led to be quiet .
as a child , i found the way i said .
as a young age , i was making you incredible to have this openness ,
but just since that , i was doing it myself for myself to do it with me , and then also open me up .
you can see the god so you 're ready for the next .
thank you .
yeah , thank you .
i 've got three miles here .
a einen and a und and a . .
and now , i 'm going to ask you , if it 's going to get , what is you going to get here to you ?
most of them would decide for the entscheiden .
and that 's a pretty good idea .
and why ?
because we get the biggest effect with the thing .
we somehow do this differently .
that 's where the world works with the biggest effect of eight and decide to others .
we choose to give us an example of the und and the für .
big , big aid .
not so much .
or we 're going to choose to . ourselves .
that 's for diet .
but very large , very large , very large effort .
for me , not so much .
and i want to tell you today about how you can get the biggest erzielen .
if you 're involved with prevention and health , you do n't get to look at a topic .
and the subject is desertification .
and the theme was reduced in germany for a while , that 's how much up to the . .
and then the number of deaths in germany were an .
and i was wondering , what was going on there ?
so why did n't we put that suddenly up ?
and then i was studying , and i 've become geworden .
because it was in the year .
what was there ?
there came nach in germany .
and we 're going to do it always and do it ?
and i just looked at it .
kommt comes through germany .
and it 's getting limited .
and in the year , the curve takes really right to go on .
and then what happens to germany ?
und and und and und and , , and as it does .
and we 're going to do it always and do it ?
well , i got one and one .
because it was clear .
sports power .
and of course , i 'm not here today to tell you that playing disease .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we noticed in common now .
the density of these and new ecosystems -- and they did n't have what we 're going to be werden and healthier .
so what is it ?
the diet ?
and there 's also a great study in the u.s .
again , the problem with parenting .
and they 've introduced into the low-fat-produkte eingeführt .
and then you want to look at a moment , what 's going to happen ?
and you 've seen , people are actually making less fat , but people are still spending less calories , but they 're always threatened .
and that was a paradox .
and that 's why they called genannt .
so we can explain that ?
you can imagine the body as a power force .
and we 've been here that we do n't have big . .
and on one side , a , , we do all of the drauf that are going down here .
and this is where the energy gets als as electricity .
now , if we put more hier here in our power here , we put it on the other side , we use the energy in the power and the power system .
the human body does n't invent the same idea .
it can reduce energy .
it 's in the form of skin .
our biggest and energiespeicher . .
what happens when we heard less than we heard it , it 's energy , and yet it turns out , it takes us to end .
the hat has increased dramatically .
there 's no life in place .
we 're just alive .
and that 's exactly what that happens .
our grandparents went up to a kilometer mile .
and we 're going to come up with one more to two kilometers , and those are the positive treatments .
there are studies that went from five -- to metern feet .
i 'm going to tell you a little bit of a mit with my friend .
do you give me more enough to the chair ?
mike , come out of the number .
mike is americans .
he 's shy , he 's not going to speak much .
and he was at the study of this study , and here 's now here .
he 's this typical cowboy-stiefel , , karohemd cowboy-hut und and he has a in in the hand .
and radio food is still eating less and more and more , and yet it 's always , and always matter .
why ?
because mike is only sitting .
and i 've just looked at how much motion would be like this day , and it 's got a break in the pocket , and at the end of the night , i left again .
and there was a thousand steps .
this was like the distance , california hat in the morning to the car with the car to the office , and there was a little coffee and going back and back .
and he came up with a thousand steps .
that means mike had 10 minutes on his legs .
stunden hours and 65 minutes were oder and mike .
now , among these conditions , they form .
and mike is n't going to be because he 's going to eat a lot , because so long , it 's a long time , and it 's not used by the way , and it 's not using the energy of the energy .
and first of all , the energy , the way you see it in your . .
but energy is , , which is n't there .
the sich give up in blut blood .
and again , she 's active and still and an in its . .
so the blowfish .
so when you put the energy into the blood , then the doctors are talking from high blood water and high . .
and this , , the da , is like , , and these little holes are happening in these . .
and a happiness is still moving the whole fat , and it 's a little und and we 're talking about oder or . .
and now , herz heart is right under pressure because it has to be the blood through these verklebten gefäße houses , and we 're talking about blood pressure .
and if that fish , you can see a trifft , it will be in the body .
and when that happens in heart , we call the heart heart .
and if that 's what happened , we call the script .
and in germany , every second of the heart and a half second is in germany .
that means , in germany , every second is energiestau .
and then it turns out , and it 's not so sick because it does n't make a musician -- because it does n't move anymore .
and if you do n't know that stuff , it 's always looking at the wrong place .
for example , the theme .
i was still going to give you a number of diet at office , and there 's suchtreffer deutschsprachige diätliteratur , .
and if each book is only just a piece of artist , and we 'd like to have this , , we would have a 30 meters of the turm of turm . .
and i 've read the time for them .
and it 's in there , and that 's really important if you give more energy , so you get more food than you eat it .
and if they give less energy than they consume it .
that 's neat .
but why do we need bücher books ?
it just makes you end one .
and of course , the need is huge , of course .
because why does a diet deserve to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet and no life .
so what they 're doing is they 're doing this for three weeks , and here we are at five weeks if we can , after this struggle , back to the normal life , into our normal lives .
what 's going on to five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
at least und and again , again , we do n't have what we did .
so every new diet , one of us , can be able to ask us to any new diet , and they can ask it to their lives in their own lives .
yes , or no ?
and if you go .
and if you do n't .
because if it does n't go out , it 's kind of zeitverschwendung .
they 're the couples who think whether we 're sick or healthy .
these are the bad conditions that make us feel sick .
and these are the good conditions that make us healthy .
and if you look at the mirror of the mirror , it will be the result of his hands .
if you look at the mirror in the mirror , it 's going to see its daily habits .
and when monkeys look into the mirror and be honest , it 's also where it 's running on .
because if he has more bad habits as well , he 's in a direction of disease .
and if you want to go to the direction of health care towards his goals , it 's not going to change your entire life .
and he just takes more good habits than bad .
and a gewohnheiten scientist diplomacy is also a great example of the human being a strange animal .
mike , it has done it for example , an movement completely by its living indem by putting every way to the car and use each of the car .
and at night he 's running on the couch and has to come to the movement .
so he 's going to ins in his fährt , and they put it up there , and then it turns out , and then you have a eingespannt , and then you would put fish back in such a band so that it 's kind of moving into motion .
and my career would have exactly the same as me .
and it was a farmer who did n't understand .
that would have said , sports is for people who do n't move .
and somehow it 's right .
why do we have to spend past in our most precious places that we have achieved in time ?
in addition , we had to take these lebensstil animals for two hours per day .
so it 's a much easier to find the movement that we have .
in the same time .
and that 's why , i 'm listening to you today today .
you know , you might , you know , you 're going to do the situation , and you 're going to drive back quickly a little bit quickly , and you 're going to notice that in the first row there 's no place .
and so what we 're looking at here is , of course , dieser this in .
we always want to leave that time .
we plan our cells to be the wege species .
we plan our whole life so that we have the wege species , but that 's not what we 're not going to do when we . .
it 's in a very different way .
and so you can actually activate the aktivieren , and find the movement to the movement where they 're auftaucht .
for example , i like to get out of it .
and i 'm the only ones to get up and down and down and down and down everyone else .
but if i 've been there , then i can tell you that .
and then i ' the movement which is just like that .
and if it comes to the kommt , 30 minutes , i 'm . .
schritte steps .
that 's about three times 10 times 10 minutes .
and a dreitausend schritte , if you go to every day every day , you 'll be able to go to the end of the day 12 , you 're not going to be in your body .
this might sound a little bit .
but as an , , as a chemist , dreihundertsechzig days in the year , we 're talking about four fünf five pounds .
we do n't have that in our bodies .
and you give me a degree of that , you know , i 'm fettknochen it .
the americans are crazy , and they 're like this .
this is a von from five pounds of fat .
that 's what i was four .
just so you see what happens to these little steps .
and if that 's the effect from this perspective , what you can do , if you really started to do something like this .
and these die , they get rid of each day each day .
and as soon as they got a little bit of a day , they go close to each other .
and if you can do that , and then at a time , you make it on the top .
then they also have . the auch .
then they 'll also be faster and stronger .
but they do n't make their health more dependent .
so they do n't make their health anymore from their thoughts and from their time .
because the most important thing to do is to make this happen every day .
and i ' .
and to me , it 's more than a shift for me to make a das that is based on a clear decision for life and for myself .
because i think health does n't have to do it with what we should need to do or do .
but health has done what we want to do .
and so today , i 'm just going to give you an idea for you .
you 'll just pick up just for the best .
and then you know what it is .
step forward .
thank you .
how did it have a leonardo out there , in the way , could be able to see the world in so incredible , wonderful way in the world with other eyes ?
and in fact , even so far on the neighborhood , what happened to be just , at all time ?
could we do it today ?
do you think that might happen with trauma ?
and how can we make that power and access to our future ?
so let 's start with the question of what we actually do with innovation ?
yeah .
technology 's technology research and development even the so-called der of government has called the title of government .
so understand me .
that 's all great .
and we can be with quite proud of it , and we may be grateful that we have in in such a lot of systems that we 've been needed to be really good at all of us .
that we 've got such incredible , unique wealth .
but what about the future ?
which challenges will come to us as a society to us ?
and who does n't care about the big force and social challenges ?
so they seem to be kind of zu .
a kind of choice .
so the economy is moving around the ecological challenges because of the entrepreneurs , we then have a great amount of effort that we then reduce productivity and efficiency .
and they want to make the world better , and they want to be able to find the world themselves in between organizations and und and und and so forth what businesses is doing so much , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course
at least zu .
but who says we need to look at all this ?
how would it be that if we 're going to grow our way into social and cultural growth ?
if technological innovation is at the same time , cultural innovation is
if economic innovation is also the same social innovation ?
so , if we could think of this , how do we think , we think , would we think about the solution of great goods and social challenges ?
and if it 's really different to other people , and if it 's really different to us , as far as we can get it out of , rather , ausbalancierte 's development ?
because what was this ?
both they did n't want to have a company , right ?
can that be ?
ask yourself .
so far , we 've always seen this .
well , fortunately , for example .
paul introduced his , with his , , with his in in bangladesh , incredibly um to poverty .
and interestingly , a lot of the time in the very least more than the federal government has done .
and he 's got als as a entrepreneur , probably , for instance , for the peace .
in fact , in the opportunity , i will be able to do something like this .
in turn , i can imagine brenner . .
ganz young guy .
that 's great , but it was also his ideal .
and yeah , so totally . .
i love that .
and if you see that , you might think about it in the face , because we do n't have to worry about our future .
yes , in the study , he started to work somewhere in one of our hidden champions . .
that makes a good thing .
that 's what it 's like to him , and it 's also very successful .
and yet , this is where it 's in him .
so he 's saying , is there more likely to be in this one ?
so this is what the u.s. level does .
sind are in .
and that 's what it 's like .
and he also kind of like this .
so the right there is the , , which is the same thing .
so he 's not going to know him personally , but that 's what he tells you about .
and there it is in the middle of the t three den that he did n't .
so , it was more likely to be surprised as he was given his head at persönlich .

and as a result , he 's a unternehmer entrepreneur .
this is a great pleasure , so with young people to work , this was his experience .
and the two , then , aneinander .
and they 've always met each other .
how would it be that if we just ? in one of these conversations from the two times ?
yeah , mr. , , like that , like that .
now , what is the difference between the und and general companies ?
i did n't understand that .
so yeah , so what we 're going to do is we start to ask a question in the question of etabliertes companies ?
so here 's already .
institutional markets , pure products , french customers , fantastic structures , there 's a . .
and you can also do exactly exactly the same thing that the big shapes .
and once they had , , even though the whole thing is clear , it can also turn .
so , what is it going to be a ? ?
so , du , you 've got it , is it 's not the small eines of a large company .
it 's something completely different .
it has a completely different character .
because it does n't have any . .
no single customer , no geschäftsmodel , , nothing 's known .
so , of course , a eine organization is a constant organization that 's trying to be able to look for a business model , finding it , is , of course , it 's mostly ist , and then it 's spread .
and you 're certainly going to understand that , of course , there are some other ways in which there are other ways to other species , very different , very different .
yeah , that 's clear .
but after what is we really looking at ?
so , i 'm ' , and it 's going to be a way to make sauhaufen money , right ?
so i 've got some degrees , and that 's very good , so that 's what seminar gefunden found in berlin , would you ?
that means . .
you know , how do you go to your company and put your life in your life .
oh no .
really ? ?
now , what do you do if you 've started to do at the beginning of peter in the beginning of 30 , what do you mean by that ?
so , then you get a career as a konsumfetischist , what ?
so what happens to your commitment , what do i know ?
and we also see the an .
so the statistics of geben gave you a perspektive perspective , because 27 percent of them have already been already in a much deeper business than before you have a huge number .
money is always the result of an successful company and a geführten company .
clearly , money is an energy tool for conservation function .
and it 's the basis of all economic . .
but never the goal of a company .
yeah , what is the objective ?

so , if i 've done what i 'm talking about , well , without a goal , there 's no way of right .
and so , goals , though , is always going to be a way to think about , and so on .
and if i did n't have that , so how can i do something i can do , i do n't know what i 'm looking for ?
so this makes me a good feeling .
so as i want to decide , and the risks that i feel like all of this is so und and an .
yes , willkommen welcome to the balance .
but i might have something for you .
a field .
so that 's already , , so it 's almost going on .
successful von from generation to generation .
a für for . .
so what do you do today ?
glaub , i mean , `` slits ? ''
so we 're always immer .
in krisen , and und and nachhaltiger , carbon dioxide .
so , it helps help .
i figure , i can give you one of them .
okay .
yeah , thank you , mr. . .
but there are only questions about this .
that can give you an idea of the importance of making sense of good questions .
can we take that one after the other , i may have a better answer ?
so the first one is , what 's i going to do here ?
yes , da . here 's what 's driving you about you , and the bigger is more than you can .
what are you going to the world ?
what do people do when they work with them ?
what are you ready to give ?
what are your inside , maybe also , you know , `` well , what 's the cure ?
why is this so important to see ?
because these are also your practice .
and how did we learn that ?
and if you want to build a ship , nicht the men together in parts of work , they 're going to collect it to make sentences , but they say , you know , for the flower , you want to be the , .
yeah . good .
so , i 'll study the next questions .
what 's my favorite zielzustand ?
what does that mean ?
yes , jetzt now , you can do your target .
ausmalen in in detail , but i ' you in front of you when you , what you do n't want to do it .
do you really know the story with the pink elephant ?
remember me there .
do n't ?
deworming .
so , watch up .
do n't give a pink spin .
okay ?
does it work ?
so there 's no pink hair .
what caused ?
there 's no pink hair .
you see ?
so here 's what we 're looking at in terms of what we do n't want .
what is the only possible possible ?
so where about this ? ?
yes , sure you do what you want .
so kannikel oder , or maybe the auf on the . .
but look at it .
by the way , what 's the point i just do is , what do you do ?
i got here with you .
let 's look at that .
somebody in in this murdured named president smith .
anyone ?
at the top of three , this was brutally of blunted death to death .
i each of you your your your your at the time that deed place .
i the the glass in the bedroom .
i mean his scones scones below-stairs .
and i 'm like my petunias in in the shed . .
arrest lady smith .
oh did you have the did you , you know ?
as any tell you one one one one one one one one one .
her .
it 's just a of of . .
the real is is observant where 's observant .
and what does it look like ?
did you notice what ?
did something changes ?
okay .
okay .
okay .
so , then we 're going to look at the bear .
and it works .
somebody in in this murdured named president smith .
anyone ?
at the top of three , this was brutally of blunted death to death .
i was each of of to your your your your at the time watching the took .
i the the glass in the bedroom .
i mean his scones scones below-stairs .
and i 'm like my petunias in in the shed . .
arrest lady smith .
and , , how do you do it ?
so i know i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
i 've seen the first time .
i thought it was n't being too .
and much more time , i was thinking about the head , could it be the whole time in the area over the area ?
through my life .
and the reason i understand it is totally meaning .
so , in order to go up , if you 're going to see the memory of our perception and our erstmal report .
but what 's really happening now ?
what ' i was , and what do i do ?
and because of that , you know , you 're able to make your sense of your perception anywhere , you know , there 's another major rural quality .
well , yeah , thank you so we get to the next question .
how could i actually come to my goal ?
so , that 's what i find good questions .
i mean , i mean , every time , every time , i do n't even know .
yeah , da . there 's a great news for you .
that 's going to be easier than you might have known this .
because if you get your sense of your inner , your inner mission , and if you put it down the hard goal , you 've read that it 's going to happen to you .

you 're not going to be able to do anything else to notice things on you .
these are the famous , du in the morning .
and even at least , i do n't know what you 're looking for , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you get more , to get there more .
and you also have a big model .
the haben have this great property .
di bush , , if it was n't going to keep that in its eingeladen meeting in tanzania .
for lunch , the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , politiker , politicians , ethnic engineers , architects and he had a very strong gepflegt .
but not in our today , where it is , is who it sich through ?
who 's right ?
but in fact , suddenly , all of these different types of things , things are , in no way , some of which might have found themselves .
well , the next question is , what 's the next question ?
and you can get successful entrepreneurs in the same way .
instead of planning big and smoke and so on the next step only step on the next step .
because what do you want to do in the area of uncertainty ?
but the lead to this very , very , very und .
and if it 's nothing , dan is looking at hackers else .
and even if the big , ausgemalte zielvorstellung of them was there , then they have other people .
so it 's really important to you as well .
that gives you the inner security .
and in the rest , what do we actually learn all do ?
even though we did n't know that , but no one was told it .
well , you 're going to do bei kids .
so this is something that 's trying to learn , this is looking like this , and this spielerische layer is also , it 's fun that in a company , it 's in a . .
and that 's exactly the gegen versus the uncertainty that always makes us think of .
yeah . thank you .
so it turns out it 's a great thing .
but i do n't know , for me in the company , but i do n't think you need to have a lot of ändern in that moment .
and , in germany , there 's always a general mood .
and i understand , there must be the politicians first worry that it changes .
okay , my boy , come with me .
like going down here in water .
what do you think , how many people can you change ?
ten ?
morton bast
ten million ?
look down there .
who you see ?
precisely .
that 's where you can change that you can really change .
or to look at it , you can see the change that you see in the world in the world .
do you think beautiful words and big work , but how does it do work ?
we still have some auf on our . .
useful in all sorts of leadership , or when you feel too small for something or when you feel a spürst , and you have all that to do .
and if you ask yourself in these situations , what are happy for you now , you 're not going to be able to make sure that you can take yourself to make you feel more powerful .
`` well , you 've got to tell you what you 're trying to do is what you 're doing right now .
and to finish , `` ask you what you actually want to do from this crisis or what bad happened is because .
so i mean , if that 's what you 've done , that 's what happened .
yeah .
wotsu vielen . thank you .
and do you think that 's going to go through my quality ?
yeah .
and it gives you all two things .
first of all , we were running on top of your inner , , which is what 's going to be in your business language .
because that means your perception .
and second , on your own sense , your inner sense of self .
because that 's what makes you like the other people to behave in .
the future is always growing when we change our own perception .
do you want to do this ?
yeah , i guess .
thank you .
all right brenner .
yeah .
so , what do you think of us ?
nice .
do you .
and how are we going to do this now ?
is this a new ? ?
i mean , yes .
clear .
but i mostly see the sehe .
heißt einhauchen einhauchen .
and that 's what the wirklich really is .
it 's a vom of the der of . .
and no , it 's new , , . .
that 's the . .
the only one , in the big famous name , has been . .
from robert über , about werner graf , oder oder , or whatever they are .
let 's just . that spirit .
and who is probably going to know from our der the next friend of our time .
you see , i 'm . .
so perhaps , it would be obvious for me to understand me with kids and their future .
instead , this is the view of the rest of my time .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i were doing the program , and i started für ,
we strafgefangene unternehmerisch , , which means you can either do your entweder , or find yourself after your local weight , and then you can imagine that .
so why do i give me all the , , so those who have failed are the great mistakes ?
our program is not so easy to understand how the programs are doing for children .
and frankly , i thought the der of the last place in the universe is where i would work .
what do you think is the most important success factor in childhood with people who we work ?
we found that there are more positive problems often of male positive technologies .
and if you think about it , why it 's going to happen in certain so , so many und , and there are often a lot of gibt that the father does n't have a surprising work that he is eating drugs , that he 's in the prison .
and if a junge boy about what he wants to do out of his life , he might have no better idea how different life would look because he has no better cause .
and he seinem his father .
i ' to you .
martin is unseres our program .
his father was obese and made all of the family .
when he was 12 , his mother died and he and his little brother had had to home .
it was the der of the great .
he was shy and und and therefore the perfect victims .
and up to the day as his little brother had been so higher , so as much as it had remained on the ground .
there was an first time going on to the first time at the first time , and he went to the enemy and he agreed .
and that day , he was suffering .
and so it was .
violence is the same thing as his father 's life .
now , the same thing i 've just described is i 've just described .
and after the age of childhood , we have a lot of oder and a lot of oder .
they do n't know much different than their resources and their umfelder . .
and then you get one day with people in jail who are just the same thing to the same level that they do n't get better enough .
what do you think , in prison , if you 're in prison ?
usually it 's not much good .
and they 're getting better leaders in the . .
they sell between drugs on a higher level and plan in the middle where they could live after the einbrechen .
and this is then going into germany , prozent percent .
that means , in germany , each french is a second one .
then there are people in the prison who really want to change .
but also , these people have a monopoly on the counter .
and there 's . .
and everywhere where they 're coming is their first identity .
whether you 're looking at a conversation , whether you 're looking at a place for whether or not you 're going to be able to build new private relationships everywhere , you 're going to be able to have this identity , with this konfrontiert that you 're in a society in society .
that 's the problem we are .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what kind of property , you think , do a lot of mit ?
they 're going to be surprised .
these are ongoing skills .
now , if you 've got a aufgebaut factory , it has a lot of von , vertriebswegen and mitarbeiterführung .
the theme of the theme has a little bit of a , , otherwise , in prison .
these are the qualities we want to use for something positive .
we start our program with a local education education in prison , three materials in prison .
we teach the benefits of goals and the economy .
each people , they write , they write their own und , and each one of them will take them into a persönlichkeitstraining .
and then we came back to the bei , in the , , in the absence of their personal relationships and also at a kind of unternehmensgründung .
what is our program going from here ?
it 's a great range of , from the zur to für for . .
we 've got a dabei program .
a very large amount of mass , and that 's what i want to introduce to you .
unternehmerisches leaders and his vom of the fast money have been very early , very early to trade .
he always had fun to do business .
it 's zum for the first time .
and it was n't particularly . .
all right .
he said to her today , he gave his second foot .
so it 's ist .
he just took in a more complicated piece , and then it went on .
and it learned how he can use his local energy for something nutzen .
he 's gone in september 13 , then zweitausenddreizehn got his für for gegründet .
cows go great , he can now live with them .
he was . very well .
and he 's here today .
i 'd like to give you möchte .
let me go back to martin , which i told him at the beginning .
and martin , after its childhood , has been able to take a education education and ended up in the hooligan-szene room .
and there were food and drugs there in the tropics industry .
he was working as und and türsteher .
for 20 years , he 's using this life .
and he tells us that he 's going to have this kind of selbstbewusstsein hat at this life .
one day he had some hard to anyone in a way that he was wurde .
it took me about the teil piece , and the dort has really changed its life .
and he learned how he could make more force more success and more quality without more quality without his source without drugs or without drugs .
and he was so excited about his decision that he 'd decided he 'd like to share .
and he wanted to become part of the werden .
this has work .
so it 's working for a number two years , and our subjects are in their way to the freedom , because he knows that if you want to change it , and if you want to change the right tools with your hand , it 's going to be much more possible than you often want to .
the basis of these successes are by people like they .
and people who are going to go to prison that would come up with each other that we 're going to come up with us to write our participants in their , , in their personal quest .
this is our , , the vorträge talks in our class , these are students who are doing machen der .
and these are our partners that are directly our participants right after in conflict .
and these people take very much from our program .
an example .
we 're making a practice called nennt .
and we then then in the middle of the room , we see a great unsere of our participants on the one , and our ability to the other side .
and i then see different questions .
and every time anyone in the room would tell you that question , it 's the line .
and here 's what we all share in all of us , whether we sit inside the prison .
but also where the differences are .
and an example of that , where the differences are , is a question .
i grew up in a sozialen social dictionary , or i had a dream of something that 's been in 1968 .
there are always many of our subjects involved in the line , and they 're very few of our people .
one of the question i 'd like to do is come up with all of us who all together , the ' i want to ask .
this is what i 'm telling you all the time .
maybe we can get a little light in the audience .
i can see you .
there are all .
wow .
thank you .
now , i 'm going to ask you a question now , and if you ask that question , you 're going to go back , otherwise they 'll be simple .
it 's kind of like our culture we 're moving right now .
i did things in my life physical things for whom i could have predicted , but not .
so if you ask this question , you 've got to go to you .
that 's important to be the car .
it 's important , perhaps low marihuana .
that 's what happens to do with not exactly the nicht .
okay .
and it 's also important , perhaps every career is not always zu .
all right .
most of them are .
we have some im in the room .
that 's wonderful , because i am happy .
thank you , you 're going to sit down .
in this question , if we put the den in the game , we 'll have a very often match in the game .
and a lot of it 's clear how much happiness you might have .
happiness with parents , happiness , with the environment , in which they grew up with the friends , but also happiness that they may not always be there if they were at the edge of the oder or they did it .
what are the results of our work ?
prozent percent of our households find out of within tagen days after their suffering .
that 's a fast fast .
prozent percent has already done .
one third of the subjects in the last year was . .
and our liegt 's seven percent .
i 've been told by seven percent of a in in germany by prozent percent .
i am . .
a kostet cost in pro jahr per year in pro .
and it 's a beautiful , , was , which is a von from seven percent of sechsundvierzig percent for sechsundvierzig percent .
when my father and i started building the gegründet , we were very crazy for quite pretty crazy .
i gave my marketingjob in in a big company .
but i have to tell you , i did n't have a arbeit job in my life .
we encourage our participants to take responsibility .
responsibility , what 's happening in your life , and it 's all responsibility of what 's going to happen in your life .
not too to hide nothing .
because that leads to a whole new position , and it allows you to actually build it again .
and so it 's very happy to me , and so proud of our participants are von by their way .
and i brought you a little video here .
movie .
so i became invited to two years and eight months because of dangerous .
i was verstoß against the zu for three years and 10 months .
i 've been able to get on board .
so , i 've got noise in two years because of dangerous . .
i was wegen körperverletzung and handeltreiben mit with . .
so , by the time i was involved in , my life has changed .
and what was important to me was that , , which is made .
because there was my absolute . .
i was n't , , sorry .
i 've taken goals .
i found a way to look at this again .
and you go to a very different consciousness , and you go out of it .
and so far , it has been more and more and more and more ohne , and then you 're always immer into something .
with the wrong people , and they do n't do that now .
well , the problem is that a lot of no haben is when the outside .
that 's the biggest problem , because it 's going to be clear to get you back into the old .
you do n't know anything else .
and by the way , through this kind of individual , , no matter what it 's going to spend is just my whole way of thinking about myself , over others , talking about what 's going on with the other society that has been completely done for me in the two weeks .
i 've heard of my first woman .
and since , six months of good , i went together with her .
so that means we started a new relationship .
and because i also have the whole und and many other things .
i 've got a lot .
i started with my family in the back of education .
so i 'm working in my classroom , i 'm sorry .
and i 'm just going to go on a zum it-systemkaufmann .
you really have to realize that there are very , very many people in the world , as for example , now , about this period of time and actually being over , i do n't know , engagement engagement that people have support .
i 'm grateful to have them come into the idea that they do so .
i 'm grateful to say you have trouble in trouble , and i 'm extremely grateful that i have to be part of that .
and also , of course , all the people who have support the support .
i used to talk about a lot of people talking about this , and that 's what i 've come up with , which is good , that does .
and that 's why i do .
and i thank you .
come to prison .
each of them has something that we can need .
whether or not they have been trained our participants to their beraten , whether it 's as if they 're in the event of a financial support .
whether they want to carry our program in a new new set of our program .
talk to us .

and let 's look at the conversation with you .
thank you .
and habe , i was at hilfsorganisation für 'nen , nepal entwicklungseinsatz in .
in a time i was doing something serious .
you know , there 's these things .
it turns out to be bewerben .
the gehen go .
it 's a clock in the elevator .
there is a lot of ways to be able to do today .
you can see how you can study umgehen .
anyway , i was also . .
with my work , and this is what i 'm doing .
now , what i really need to talk about today is .
and not of real problems .
my problem was i was und , and i could really figure out exactly how my life would look like in 10 minutes , 30 years ago .
it was . .
and that fand thought i was scary .
to make it informed .
basically , i had a quarterlife crisis website .
wie like . .
i just did n't know if i was going to go to the weg path ?
do i just feel ashamed ?
or what if i could make my nochmal again ?
and look what happens .
then i 'm waiting .
that was like the thought .
i was in this era at a time .
as i said . .
the war was also even in spite of der of the absolute classroom .
you put out all of the world in a very good tree , and you put the country into a very art way .
but also , auch also , very länder countries .
in fact , developing countries where there is a lot more to be able to see , and they would say when they were talking about dörfer villages with pretty einheimischen group , even though they have nothing , much happiness and joy .
and in fact , from these images and lebt , there 's a gewissermaßen situation .
and that was exactly what i was looking for a while for a while .
i was what i was doing .

and also , i found a little von from me to write a country i did n't really know exactly .
and that 's what i wanted to change .
i wanted to give countries properly .
we can write artikel articles .
and to give my personal interest .
how do you teach countries better ?
by seeking people lives .
people are living in the people .
not in the hotel .
by seeking the challenges and the problems of people .
and by using people working .
at least , that was the answer i could give in the question .
and that 's what i wanted .
and i wanted to make something hard .
i wanted to make a dialogue .
something good .
and this sense of me in front of me , in a noch , still try to grow .
i 've had a lot of developing countries in the developing world , but i was just really touched myself .
until herrschte , a bürgerkrieg civil war did n't only have low government , but many economic and social problems left .
with a $ $ income of euro dollars , das is the poorest country in south asia .
and also , one of the 20 poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below poverty .
almost one fifth of the population is suffering .
forty percent of adults ca n't read and write .
all of these facts are connected to a lot of personal stories and experiences that i met on this journey in a time in which i was ready and open for change .
in fact , i wanted to change something .
and for me , after my family came out of my apartment .
i quit my job .
and lastly of aid .
and i 'm also going to give you a demo of the answer that i had on my job .
because she 's just a war .
it 's going to be a serious case of international international powers .
and it was n't to be a für for a weltenbummlerin die that wants to be a mal and a support of her journey .
hello ?
does it go ?
my job was really serious , and good .
at least , i thought .
and the answer was a frechheit . .
i was really . .
and yet , of course , it 's a fairly emotional response .
well , never . .
instead , i 'm very powerful feeling about making something good .
i used it as a motor to make my own company .
deworming .
nick and and travel . .
a company that basically basically exactly what i was looking at .
that 's the possibility of a country differently .
the possibility , a country really started .
by trying to live with people else and work .
and it 's not going to be working anywhere , but it 's not entwicklungsprojekten .
you can catch the way in two words .
so und and . .
that means much , like the place you can do good things .
you can do good .
now this may sound a little bit more . .
it 's not .
ist is a social business business .
we use silk as a tool for sustainable development .
also , we use als as a tool for sustainable development .
so , , cannon and . .
because the people who would travel with us during their very home .
they pay for their journey , like in one else .
but they just travel differently .
they live in . .
and the principle is not much oder , or much more sondern .
social computing .
and . .
it turns out to be our participants , and we 've changed our participants and interests in different projects .
we can do a lot of work in areas that otherwise we could do n't have any chance in the traditional condition .
because simple infrastructure is missing .
the other thing we can build is sustainable projects .
we can enjoy our sustainable projects and prevent ourselves .
so we 're spending to a hundred percent ourselves .
they 're not paying to support .
and this is us for the work of what we 've been doing for our work .
we started with our work in beijing .
jahr years we have our commitment on uganda .
and now after four years of us , i was married and my husband and i have a team with a team a team .
let 's go to the weg path ?
or what if we think about that bigger ?
now , if we even make that back further ?
in fact , if we do n't only have social computing and sustainable travel , then do we mean that in his direct way ?
and that 's what the individual miteinbeziehen industry is ?
or some special individual . .
so basically , it would be a new company .
a company in companies .
in other words , the same philosophy as . .
do we want that ?
the next question was the next question .

certainly we want that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're in a moment .
because we asked the same language .
because we sent the same dream .
because we understand the challenges .
and so , in this year , we have a sister in this year .
deworming .
and with fördern , we add a creative company in our development and in the process of using extraordinary people .
and we 're looking at people , entrepreneurs or employees from creative companies with individual development .
so these are the personal social and weiterentwicklung development of beinhalten .
and then they . the . .
they also have a lot again .
a effort to push the potential of a potential cost a second one .
he shows one in relatively short time where you 're standing or where you 're . .
but where you might have a little vorurteile sandwich .
where you might be a little ist , to think of yourself .
and he 's showing you , which is really good .
it takes one of his strength .
it 's the creativity , suddenly , a great one .
or if it 's the fate that you 've discovered .
the unknown things that you ca n't change .
and the force , things to change that you can change .
and you can change a lot .
in a very short time .
we know that .
one example .
these are rose margeret , and und and . .
they are five very wonderful women from uganda .
i mean , it 's schicksalen .
she wunderschöne beautiful , frozen seit for years .
and for years , nothing happened .
because they did n't have a market .
because they do n't know how they can improve the quality .
because nobody told me what design might be in .
we wanted to help these women .
and in this year , we started a gegründet program .
empowerment product . .
products are taking people from poverty .
they give them an income .
a future will .
we went out with our live live yesterday .
and we 're starting with a empowerment edition . .
a edition von of thousand von of our women .
he 's not only selling them for a year .
but it also allows us to make a lot more bigger .
this first ist is kind of social numbers , and in in one .
so , the ability to support this is to do that for one of you can do for a data , but we can actually travel on the project .
it can travel the women .
in the long time , we do n't want to give five women a job , but a hundred and a half .
and this is not just in uganda , but also in beijing and other , in which we 're working on arbeiten .
now , of course , this is just a project from our zyklus cycle of projects .
we 're working in all central fields .
in the area , education and and health and environment and . .
because the work in only is just too little .
what happens to children when the women work ?
right .
that 's why we started in essex , in uganda , and in uganda , we started two centre neighborhoods .
everything happens in our life .
and the whole thing has more meaning than each one project .
we 've seen what we 've ever found in the different projects .
they 've always had the same opportunity in common work .
and to conclude , i want to take you right now on a journey .
and i 'll tell you the eyes .
come in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting at a esstisch .
and it 's und and . .
you just ate with your zu .
there was . .
deworming .
tasty .
the walls are . .
in fact , it 's warm .
you aus from the window .
and these kids are . . .
their füße foot den the sand .
you put on your . .
they 're a thin oranger staub .
the children are laughing .
and call fun your name .
you 're not dich you ca n't call it .
deworming .
you do n't know how tomorrow it is .
but soon you will get up .
and the , , on the one hand , were called children .
at the end of the street , a great tree .
this is where you 're going to meet them .
in the 1990s , in the shadow of the mountain , you 'll notice the new design of your besprechen .
as soon as you get hands and you 'll talk to them .
and later , the other women come up .
she smile an .
until you . your english .
under the tree .
in free .
it 's amazing , but there 's still the internet .
tomorrow wieder again with your hair .
that 's what you 're looking for .
the exchange is , every time .
it 's also nice to speak to that .
you hear music .
and the von of . .
mom wäscht im im innenhof innenhof .
she ate a local song .
you 're und and happy .
you can make the eyes again .
each of us can meet the zu of some new particles .
or at least for a short time , they 'll be able to get the spread back again .
and here 's what happens .
thank you .
before i start looking , i 'd point out if one of you tonight that you 're here , before you 've got a haus house .
i 'm ' by the light , but maybe someone wants to survive .
here 's a down there .
two .
now i 'm afraid i 'm not , but in any case here , there are two , which is beautiful , we 've been on it .
i was also a building , and it 's the longest mountain in the east of the city .
that 's the building .
together with two other people in the last summer age six months .
and that 's why i left here tonight .
well , some of you might say .
what 's the point ?
there are many .
but i want to explain it short .
oh what , you 're looking at the basics now ?
and your business then started to park , or how ?
there 's only a small sample of questions that were known to us , our friends , our friends , when they have learned that i have part of one of the protection that i was working with , something called namen .
everybody expected that we had in into the range of eingereiht hatten .
and this is where they 've been building , verbreiteten und , verbreiteten .
and to . the quality of these statements .
but who knows , it 's not my kind of . .
and it was n't the protestform der of the government .
what we 're seeing here is a sign of passage in stuttgart .
this is a public space that is very private , and so for many people ca n't say for it , i 'm not saying , but it 's not so used in public hand , and that 's not how to use public spaces .
we 've had a group of vereint in in the desire with bausubstanz und and sinnstiftend , and und and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell another erzählen .
we were a team , and that 's what i 'm going to do now , because it was a very team team .
from the areas of architecture , urban social social and politics -- and stadtforschung , , statistics , design , music , photography , , und and . .
of course , with various social cultural and personal . .
our research und and sich .
and the ability to do that , in various terms , also on various networks .
and creative part of lösungen solutions in the , that we 've done to realize zu .
we 've actually chosen to . the priests .
but it was really about us that we 're going to sit out of stories and ideas .
we 've asked memory and pictures .
and from these memories and images , they 're trying to develop ways to develop the brakes .
it was important to us that the process is happening .
we do n't know what we 're going to do as a u.n. , we 've used to be plattform and . .
this was like a und and besetzen und and turned to a . .
in the words that we 've done , what i 'm going to do is go here tonight .
every city has orte places .
there are a face .
in many cases , this was und and und , and being seen in the origin of citizens as teenagers .
they 're the dead places in the city because they do n't really expect to what we expect in a public space .
so for example , we have haben .
they 're going to do that , but also the public ones , the urban places , it 's often . .
mm , which want to go back to these places , often , often , most of the other things we do .
what has also got to do with me like this is to do a few questions , some of the ones get questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places are not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of our city where our social lives are happening .
so we 're often going to do the first bande of dna to our neighbors if we meet our way to the screen .
and if we can just have an opportunity to sit up , and we 're actually , when the spaces are designed as well .
and we just have längeres on time .
that 's where they form , sometimes .
but what matters is a sense of community .
and the more i can do in this kind of public space , the faster and the more way of the other community .
and if i 'm not , , then the thing that you 'll call is the emergence of a brand .
we then went two challenges .
we can do it in terms of consciousness , responsibility and productivity for their neighborhood , or in the auch .
how can geeks be turned in creating new advances ?
how can in be turned into ideas ?
gegen against congress and caregiving in these bedeutsamen sites and gegen die and also not the eben of the same places .
now , imagine now that you 're sitting here , again , you get the newspaper and read the following text .
love religious and citizens , we 're in charge of us to be able to introduce three possible solutions for the des of vorstellen that we 've created before ,
you can think of the idea of an option .
and the proof of most of the people in the bürgerstimmen are actually . .
would you go ?
would any of you go to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds so awesome .
there 's no way of what 's going on .
you can , the way that looks in the future .
and as i said , a great thing about the first moment .
i 'm trying to talk about an explanation .
and that 's because i think that 's not really what i think you ca n't really choose or whether or whether or it 's or social .
first of all , traditional häufig are often too late .
that means that you do n't have any opportunity to make your own ideas to solve or fundamental alternative , but it 's actually known design , and you can also decide whether they 're oder or in in the urban city .
or , as a friend of fact , that color gave you for example .
the second explanation of classic geht is mainly about information and accountability .
think about the three varianten style .
what we 've got here is , we want to show you , and it 's got to vote .
frustration and sind are often the effects of what i find kind of finde .
i do n't want any decision about oder or treffen , if i 'd actually have bmx strecke instead of blumenbeet gehabt .
but it 's also different .
but even though the der of the world 's population , we have a lot of erfahren experience .
and so we made experiences and i want to share with other teilen .
i 'd like to share it to other , , other projects , but also , of the city and the politics .
because those are the ones that are actually going to do these things , and are actually responsible for these things .
now , if it 's really interested in terms of what it 's so often und , and then we need to get it , and then we need to have new . .
so at the end of the day , i was all that you 're all right now .
and that 's why i think very important to it .
it 's important that they 're all going to go , and i want to give you with our example of being a chance of a chance .
and i teach them all , because they 're the ones who can give up a new einfordern .
so what we need to do is look forward to the citizens in terms of the citizens , responsibility of , responsibility and commitment to their states and how do you think of und and zu ?
first of all , they give you on a ride .
in treffen , auf , citizens are made of und and different interests .
what we 're seeing here is a particle model that we asked .
what we see here are some und and im in conversation .
the goal has to be that all of these conversations in a screen , so they do n't have the interessen interests or the kompetenzen of the skills of citizens .
the citizens are experts , they 're experts for their neighborhood , they know what they 're missing , which is a place in which tradition a place is a place , and also what they 're missing to you .
the , , especially at the city can be able to do what 's going on to the project in the project .
in prison or in a particular case , other einbezogen can be created the stories that are in the project .
that all leads to a , , where all information for everyone is available and then can get to the place .
and then , by that , you can also be able to be able to be able to keep a copy of the site .
it also means that the desire of the favelas are actually serious .
and also , when somebody says , i want to give you a neben about this .
now , of course , this is true of the science , but the goal has to be , in any sense of all the things that you see , what is the right solution , and perhaps in the dann , and it may be in a different place .
as i said , it has to come out of this .
the second point is a variety of . .
our ist is . .
in a sense , if it comes to großen great group and talk .
another one can write good , but the text would not have to speak to the text .
some of them might be a little bit or . .
or build its ideas in mindmap auf .
so what i 'm going to do is to give up a different kind of task in order to be able to do different kinds of
so for example , we 've got the opportunity for instance , and we can get to be there before what happens .
in the background , small shows .
we 've had the opportunity to give us zu .
we 've had the capacity to paint .
we 've had the capacity to write up .
regardless of age .
this was a mädchen girl .
we had the opportunity to connect our ideas to ideen ideas .
also , the way to deal outside of zeitunabhängig is to be given .
so , for example , this could happen to you about a passieren , which is able to happen about aids passieren .
and the und and dramatic forces of the outcomes are actually den by people .
we even have this whole process going on facebook , and on one of them and at one of them and at the same time and at the same time .
our third point . .
you may remember , i told you that oft often too late .
in my veranstaltung event , it was already three planungen .
ist is the process , but it 's only when it comes straight , and if you do n't even know what 's going to happen to you .
and when it comes through , i 'm going to get back to the point in the moment , wird , which will give you a place in the area .
gehört belongs to be a selbst self .
and then , if it 's not at the beginning of ist , the veranstaltung of all that is going to look and so forth by the experience of the previous aufbaut .
what 's happening is when citizens stadt their city and their city .
it 's already in a lot of projects .
i 've got an example here in , , which is , , probably in many of here .
in new york , a project came out there 's a . .
in crowdfunding-kampagne sind , over six weeks of dollars , they 've got the funding to make it possible or at least . .
at the time , politics could not be different to make the idea of their own .
also the in in new york , which i do n't have to say , because it 's got to be one of the most important der in the city was not an idea of politics or government .
in the opposite , the für for standen have been found .
so in , , we 've gone back in germany , citizens already have pläne plans for a place .
the city had said to be ist .
the four weeks , that we have for military species , which is less than aus .
today 's the der of the city rouge .
as the page goes down , the city is wonderful , and the city has the , , which is the u.n. that came out there and other unterstützt .
in addition to that , you know , your own auf citizens .
in denmark , a fußgängerbrücke . .
all right . you want to say that .
now we 're just going to go now .
but i think it 's wrong for me to leave the city .
why ?
one , because they 've got a look at it .
as it turns out , it might be citizens in terms of citizens , or businesses in some form matter , the city has a responsibility for projects that are also on the edge of attention .
and for others , if the city has its projects , there are other .
it can only be a kann economy .
even our goal , by the way , was a constant initiative that gave him after a half of the year of working the outcomes and the responsibility of the city .
we 've had a hat effect in the january .
it 's still running there .
that 's why , unfortunately , we have the problem right now that we do n't have the responsibility yet .
but we know , in any case , when the city is successful zurückkauft , if the odds are actually successful , that it 's going to be an stattfinden .
but in which form of space , it 's also open .
so to finish , i 'm convinced that a lot of projects can be in terms of their meaning , complexity or their cost of the city must be a chance to create happiness and zu .
and if you get only time and you get to the citizens .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each other , you 'll see that you 're sitting here tonight .
if we demand our business and at the same time , we do n't see how much than a wahrnehmen , but as a . .
that 's it .
yesterday , after the waren day , we were here in im und , and we came into the gekommen .
we talked about gesprochen .
so this idea of trying to have a second chance to have a second chance in this life when it has n't been done in this life , it 's going to have a second chance .
we found so interesting .
and we were relatively quickly telling us that there are two things we did n't have to experience .
one is in accident .
the second thing was immediately am in the table at the table .
no .
no .
school , some of you may remember raus klassenarbeit .
i mean , it 's like this . now it 's jahre years , but the words are bei me immediately .
my professional sich , and i just want to leave it back .
and i do n't know what it was like to you , but when i was in my career , it was always taken by the ernst seriously who was always looking at me .
i do n't know what 's going on in the situation .
they 're going to understand it , so my school was n't quite beautiful , and after i had my last hinter behind me was completely clear to school .
and what i 'm going to say is , if i put some of the most beautiful days i 've spent there , i spent in schools .
it 's a lot of fun and a total failure .
so how did it came ?
how could this happen ?
it just started with something happened , which i could n't love .
i got children .
so my wife got the kids .
and that 's because it 's clear that it 's the key to make these zu .
until that day , when she said , `` honey it 's . .
and here 's where you go .
yes , . .
that 's where i opened the door and then i sat there in this und and i felt in in the . .
and this looked like this .
and it also goes like in a way to school , and i swear to myself , and i do n't have any of the time to do that .
and when i left the teacher , and you know , the kids do n't learn for school , but for all of life , i 'm like , oh , my god , the sentence i did n't have . me .
what is it that we really did out of school in the school in school , actually ?
so many of us have dort there really well .
where did they have in their life in their life , what do they need to do in their life ?
and maybe some people know what the capital of terror means .
now , what else ?
or , , this ability to make a lot more of knowledge in terms of time , just so that i can then make it on a wieder , until i 'm bad ?
good , i 've been doing it for the , , but otherwise ?
and what does a von face of a subject is someone who 's a good doctor ?
is it possible , is it possible for the good hadron properties ?
no .
so , no , for life , not for school .
if we look like this , about jahre years , in the middle of the jahrhunderts century , that 's what we have ended up .
this is the time in germany , in germany , in germany .
and where it was , where it has been , its roots has its roots .
and if we think of time at that time , it was actually , in fact , people had no access to know of their time .
and there were those four or six years that they 've been forced to go into school and know with knowledge that were really the only way that had had the knowledge and the facts and the information of their time .
today , a mehr more information in its pocket than the largest library of the time .
and in the middle of the jahrhunderts century , that was the time of frustration .
that means there 's some changes in the world , and there are people need to get these new machines .
but at the same time , people have to have to have these machines and fix these machines .
and we needed people to bring these machines and put them into these factories .
maybe they do it .
the schulsystem camp that we have in germany in germany has its root in this time .
and there might be something like that .
again , because it was probably so much , that what i learned in school is the work for work at the bottom line , who was at the bottom line , which was there for his life .
let 's make a break look at the future .
let 's go to the jahrhundert century , where it is , and let 's look at that year .
the year that year was there was the first gerade ever ever before before .
i was ready with my studies , and i thought now is the time now , now you 're going to do this , the first company .
yeah , after some of us , about the internet , and then i say , `` well , i 'm going to have this now .
and some businesses have been around us , and we 've been getting bigger and bigger and bigger , and we 've gotten so nice slowly , and some of the companies they have is in the lower case .
you can see two times in life .
and we had a couple of years ago .
so we came up with a nice growth , and we had an extraordinary conversation on the board like , , community-manager app-entwickler .
i do n't know if you have konkrete vision what these people are doing , but what i did when i was in school , we did n't have any idea of what ever would have .
even when i made it up from something like the internet did n't speak .
and the kids we are going to send in school are to send our job in 10 , 15 , five or 30 years years ?
the only honest answer is what we have no idea .
and what do you know , what will be the facts you need to be successful in this future ?
and if you 're honest , the only answer is , we have no idea .
and because we have come here to the future , i could give you the future of who i could give you the für .
you have jackpot , . i read .
well , look , you have no idea .
how do we get out what to learn to us ?
what are the things we need to make children living in life ?
and maybe it 's a way of looking at what businesses is looking at today .
that 's the number of school , yes ?
the aus from schools and universities come into companies .
and if you look at random anschaut , then you have the first one , you know , like the . .
so , the idea is , so the reading is going to do so , we 're looking for military hochschulabsolventen mit , with 10 years , and about 12 years old .
now , you can do this in the future .
but what school might mean is the things that will always be important , these are the ones that soft skills , and i 'm sure that these skills die will be the basic der in the future .
and it 's in the principle of three groups .
this is to be one , businesses wants to die that are linked to them , so that 's what they serve is .
and then you want to think about all the businesses in the business .
and then they want these companies who are sind .
so we have cognitive leaders thinking and . .
let 's start with mortgages .
that 's relatively fast .
if we look at how economies works today , how fast it is , how quickly changes it .
, , the whole thing is going to be . from the internet of the internet .
i do n't need to share for you guys who can study the change .
i mean , there must be a staff .
i mean , there must be a staff .
this is quite exactly the opposite of what was needed in the factory end of the jahrhunderts century .
the second issue is the problem .
there 's responsibility .
there 's people who take responsibility .
first of all , and your own life .
but also for the big whole .
whether it 's the company or even as a society , we want to be able to help the responsibility for the big whole .
and the third thing that 's going to do is that it 's almost at the time .
and if we remember the wm , then there was this beautiful statement .
hollywood has messi messi reagan , and germany has a team .
it was n't broken , who won the gewonnen .
and they could do that in common .
and as anybody who 's been so , this great minority of our time , steve jobs , yes , . .
it was n't the idea that was invented the iphone , who did n't invented the erfunden , who did n't invent it , did n't invent it .
he had a team that made it possible , because only as a team , they could make what they 've done .
so high school , who could get these three things that are at the time that we learn live in .
but there is also some other fourth , and it 's almost more important to me .
and that 's what is learning itself .
if the only thing we can say about the future of security is that it 's grateful , it 's the ability to learn and to learn new and fun that learning of understanding of the time that we live in the future , and that our children in the future are successful life .
now , the only thing to do this is to school .
but where was i ?
i was sitting in this und , and those of you who have kids , who know that this is n't what you have to pay for .
so , as a result , funny after all , it 's still not from any .
so at the time , where gewählt is being asked , then all of a sudden .
yes , i sat there , and what i 'm going to do is to say , at the end of one of my children , these were the teile parts of the event .
less fun , it was as a dad when i was a kid in order to und the subject and learn the entire program .
and less fun , if the child is sick , because in school 's school , it 's hard .
and finally , this oder , or was a member of these an to this school , again , like elternabend . .
in fact , it was n't a , , it was kind of like a , , so right after the last decade and in reality , we were also the only parents who were invited to .
and i ' them now , and also the details of this time was clear , and we have to push our child there .
now , sind are two years where we 've been .
what are we doing wrong ?
and we were actually the question asked to our child .
and are we the only ones that go to this ?
now , i was in the last two years since i was talking about this , and i 've talked to you about a lot of people i 've been talking about , you know , not alone .
there 's a lot of them out there , and this was two years ago , and there was two years ago , and there was only a new company that we were working with , where the journey go to us , and at night we sat on the table , and we sat across private things .
and what i 'm going to say is , he 's almost the same story with one of his kids , he 's almost the same as we did , and we had this happiness that we could put our children out of school , yes ?
in berlin , there is a riesenauswahl an of different schools , and we could even consider schools .
but can this be there ?
somehow it was too much to get our kids to care and to get these da out there , as they are .
and after we both have the meaning , we did n't change in school since we were n't so much changed , it 's good , we are the first to have the right now .
only , how are we going to change something like that ?
the good thing is that we have haben .
we are not alone .
but we 've seen relatively quickly a lot of amazing people doing great people doing the same thing that we wanted to do , which is to school that 's going to work all the time .
it 's not that only the children and their parents under suffering are what happens out there .
if we look at teachers , 30 percent of teachers have . .
if we look at how the number of people in the last 10 years has changed the last 10 years .
now can it be that all parents doing what wrong do ?
that all children are raised , and that is the teachers they have broken ?
or it can be , you know , we have a school system that just does n't look like this , like this vor , jahren years ago , which is just the same as well .
and we found a lot of people who did this , and we even found people who do n't have children .
and they understood that they need to take responsibility for the future they need to take responsibility to the future by what we do for our children and the kids that go to school in the school .
and we 've come to zweiten second , where there are all kinds of great , that want to change school , and there 's schulen schools , and there 's schulen schools , there 's schulen schools , and there are some great und and there are almost on to any school teachers who actually want to change something .
and even there is one or other other speakers that are then going to be the first step .
and how should we help an helfen ?
we did n't have a concept that we could do it right now .
but we can do what we can do , we can go into these schools and we can , these schools , so the parents , the teachers and the students , and we can do that in two days .
so there are people who worked in the past as well , and learn in two days to work with each other .
they are coming with ganz very concrete challenge to solve them .
and after two times a few days , then , for example , they have developed a new entwickelt or they could give the competition entirely new places like us in a remote school .
or , you know , they have maßnahmen issues for probleme problems that they have in school .
within two days , you can be able to be detected by the next day .
but what is most effect , what happens to these two days , and that makes it so beautiful , so that it 's so nice to me that it 's so nice to me , then also to spend schools in schools , is that energy , which gives me three things .
and when the three things together together , what kind of dumb . .
so business thinking , when you start a team .
and that 's like a model , the . .
and if we were to go four weeks to this , then to school , we start to realize that school began as a whole , to change that there 's completely new culture .
and this is incredibly hot .
and i ' . they asked me to think about school .
i 'll invite you to think about school .
and i ' them too , you know , to talk about school .
talk about what you 're trying to do but talk about what you do n't like .
they 're going to be surprised how much they can do , and how many people do the same thing , but they just do n't .
let us bring them every single school in germany in germany .
let 's change the whole system system .
and let 's put that together with people at school day , with the parents , the teacher and the students .
because we can do that in common .
thank you .
