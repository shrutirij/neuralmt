yeah , good , ladies , my sister .
thank you for coming here today .
and i have to imagine now .
my name is brown und , and i am a strange reaction to eat the city .
that 's called für for eight years .
and my favorite favorite is : first of a child , the second organization , the public change .
so for instance , i 'm interested in this city .
you do n't do that .
i know .
and it 's out , and this is something that my son really like , i 'm also . .
this is the head of feuerwehr fire .
berufsfeuerwehrleute und and ehrenamtler ehrenamtler .
and i think , of course , a theme is important with what i want to give you today .
that 's the theme of , , because it 's an issue .
and we hope for the best part and we put ourselves in the worst part , that 's called oxytocin .
you know it .
he was once electrics . .
and then i do n't really start to say something wrong .
i 'll give you one .
that 's what we 're going to talk about , if there is a risk that we 're going to be right before a disaster , for example , for example .
a lot of people are on .
it feels itself .
and somewhere at the top of it is a shepherd , verlassen , etwas , maybe mit .
no one seems to be true .
the woman belongs no .
suddenly a . .
leave the . .
police comes down , fire , . .
people are calling .

go out .
what is next ?
we do n't know what we do n't .
people are leaving the building .
children hate .
some people might even , because it has to go fast .
suddenly a game game .
there 's drin inside .
a panic aus .
i 'm going to hear now .
the rest of my imagination .
but it 's not a clue i 've chosen . slits ?
and this is what happened in this week in a week .
there 's one such liegen .
after then , it turns out that it was only , nine pounds of drugs .
but people were like that , and so a friend has told me from the building .
it was n't said .
and this was exactly what was happening in the group of days that my friend was in my friend .
thank you . thank you .
you can see , in a , , in a katastrophe disaster , communication is a very important deal .
and communication is really important because people in this situation are actually nach .
they want to know what 's going on .
in the same time in the good age of time , it was pretty easy for surgery .
we just did n't know or we lied .
why ?
because what we found is the herrschte .
you 've got to say about it , god , people are going to panic , because we do n't have to be the truth or we say the . .
this is in a time of social media , in a time of afghanistan , in a period of private and public care , in a period of und and public tv .
simple and it 's because it 's not an issue . it 's not a funny thing to do , and the second thing is that we are at the past of the world 's past .
you may even remember the solar system in an exponential river , some years ago .
first of all , take on twitter .
by someone who was on a party and simple and emotional immediately immediately , here 's a plane und , and we 're saving people now .
that was not a . .
and you can see , we are ready to be simple and beauty of , to say the truth , to be very zu .
because mostly we are , of course , the last , the truth that the truth will know because we have to pay attention to , of course , that we 're only informationen information .
so , public media , or private media , they ca n't do it very well , or they do n't .
so that 's why we 're going to eat in food , and this is also something that has been through the media , we think about how we deal in the future .
and we 'll get the good old wieder back again .
but only as a form of the . .
that means that we 're going to put in the next few years , we 're going to build this next hundred in into the aufbauen , which , some of you know it , wenn when it comes to kommt .
and it was a time .
you may know what several times a little bit of time , a moment , a long time .
i do n't know anymore .
we 're going to do this today today with all the , that we have in this place , so , , over facebook , about twitter , over the radio auch at night , talking about tv , and the local media and so on and on again , of course , with , , to get to the information continue .
and we know we need to be there , very quickly , and we have to look at it very quickly , and we 've got to be there very quickly , and we 've got to look at it very quickly , because the japanese and the citizens will have . themselves .
and we end up just more than what we want to say .
so communication in the crisis , or in the disaster , has a question about all the media that are available to us , and it 's also a question of non-zero-sumness .
we have a big problem of our biggest problem , because the religious and citizens are going to tell us , `` well , they 're not going to go back , or they 're going to say it 's not going to be much worse than it is in reality .
we 've also done good experiences with facebook and twitter , just recently .
and they may have some of them in the media .
we had a bigger in in food .
and this one is called a chemical bomb .
these are bombs that are einem with a ausgestattet camera , because that 's not just the first auf on the explodieren , but through the houses in the second world war center , and only at the bottom of a chemical reaction that 's been considered that a little bit of a , , the flüssigkeiten , two von of one of each other , is that it , , and then it came down .
the problem is only a lot of these bombs , and they are in the unter of other in food .
and there we were , from a older friend who was going to , as he said so beautiful , the way he said so he 's going to do so he was wollte , and he was now , he saw as she was dreiundvierzig gefallen , and now he 's got the funding over that there is a bomb .
by the time , several and a half of friends have im in the whole lot of the
we 're going to see what we find .
these bombs have to be immediately immediately in place , entschärft , but werden .
and so what we did is we simply do a simple park in the park park , which is , in fact , the word of the word to the word .
and in addition to the history of the city , the whole communication over facebook and twitter is about the consequence that the entire weit far on the follower world .
and the media was . . stay in the background .
we did n't even have to go with the phone , but they have und and , , all about und and twitter .
the whole thing had a great impact for us , because the wird is going to reduce its social media .
simple , you have to give me a sign if i 'm supposed to stop .
i ca n't look at the clock .
this is the deswegen , because first of all social media have the advantage that they share very information .
not so much that are very sind because the members are coming down there or the , , as you call it , a high haben .
secondly , fast . .
if something is n't really true , i write somebody immediately , so that 's what i 've been talking about , that 's because the whole community is in the principle of the cause .
and it 's a very high thing , so if anything is wrong , it can be werden very fast .
and we have a huge . .
and i said , `` well , that 's kind of like a break in the park park .
so what we 've done from all the things that are happening in the last few years is that it 's a lot more passiert than it is , as a einer of a knowledge .
also , the city of food can be werden by such a disaster .
a bomb that needs to be werden in a park is not such a difference .
but it can also be , and it 's also what we 're looking at , and it 's also wir , and then we 'll stand up with our und and try it up in seven feet .
and if you think of it , you think of yourself , you think about other cities , if you 've got to get rid of it , because you have something called a hat , you do n't know what you 're going to do now , you know , a number of houses are not going to look like before .
and to communicate that is important , one because it 's necessary in one world in a world , it 's necessary to avoid communication , to also prevent it , to help it worry that people are needed to help that the people in the position are able to put into this difficult situation .
and the social media helps us to be involved , because ultimately , they all look at it in terms of communication , and it 's not just a behördenkommunikation ist of how we in the , and und and certainly in the zum for big part .
so today , today is not just an issue of the government industry , not just an example of the oder or the , , the , , the kreuz , red walls , but of course , in terms of a disaster , we 're all going .
and hat has shown this .
there 's a lot of the help , and there 's a lot of the help , if one of the things that we were working with is because of all of people wanted to build it , because suddenly they wanted to create von of people 's von , and they did n't even know where they were .
this is what it 's like , there 's a lot to do , also for public communication in the , industry , but the ball that 's going to have to show is the social media set out of a , , out of communication , not to think of communication .
and i hope that i 'm convinced you a bit a little bit about the fact that this medium , which is , in fact , for the beautiful things of life often is being used , even in seinen its sense and the purpose , and that we 're as a city that is still a new instrument in the future of the future , the instrument in the future of the future as well as far as it is , and it 's very different to her , to the people of the funding and the citizens and the other , and that 's what i end up with , and i 'm going to tell you the whole time i 've ever seen .
thank you .
so a wonderful good evening .
i 'm anders .
i 'm a writer and , , as you 've heard before .
and i 'm also now now to have a personal zu .
what it means is that i 'm going to create out there , which i 'm in a moment .
before i do this , i need a few things .
the first one is , i think we really need stories to life .
we ca n't live without stories .
and also , i think there 's a lot more , , sehenswerte , geschichten stories than from the traditional crisis .
and then i think the internet that is weiten , which is , in fact , as well as not bespielt is really cool .
and four and four , i believe that people were designed to be creative .
and they 're happier once they 're going to be creative .
the more people are happy , the better the world is .
totally chen .
now , this is a better world now only one oil .
in the first line , i 've said , `` well , listen to me .
and the story i want to tell you is starting to tell you about what you 're starting to do is wird in a beach that 's called happy gesungen .
that 's . .
and it 's einundzwanzigster geburtstag 's birthday .
now , they get off of the und , and they do n't have that much thing , because in the moment it has gotten up in 1950 , it 's going to happen to you .
it happens something in your head , in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really have words .
you do n't know what 's going on there .
i have a word for this .
i 'm going to call this the von of . .
you 're looking at a page and you 're in in und , and everything 's quite black .
i feel like i was kind of a kind of . .
deworming .
and on the other hand , we 've got the two and a lot of color in the country .
and it was at this point that i said i 'm better news and writing , as i do .
so the first thing about what is happening with your new perception is a close man with rotem , hair , who is before you 're very serious , and says , `` oh , your life is over .
that 's . .
and klärt alea darüber on that she belongs to a whole special kind of people .
she was born as a geboren .
players are people who have to play their way down to their lebensjahr .
who knows that ?
nice .
imagine if you 're talking about the activity in nicht , if you meet it , it 's aus .
so dry , mikadostäbchen , alles , everything else .
what 's important is that the players do n't have any insight on their . .
we do n't know when we die .
i mean , i wish everybody a long time , but we do n't know .
it can be a game already .
and so it 's also like that .
they do n't know how much they can do .
that means every single day could be the last .
a player who has grown up all of his entire life , im in the moment of the wie like a , .
now , you can ask , obviously , if this is so dangerous , why does it happen to work ?
and the answer is clear : that .
without play , without a um , alles , all gray and only when a player play , he actually is alive .
they were born .
so .
this story of und , and as you are now the world of the player , ihren the first challenges , and , of course , in verliebt in love , which is the story i want to tell you .
and it 's in the form of a . .
the first headwind has 12 consequences , and sorry , i 've seen a passiert here that i 've seen .
so 12 implications in the first run of each to seven minutes .
this kind of , , a consequence for the other , beautiful erzählt tells you .
the television has nothing for its nichts .
that 's not new .
and if it were anything i 've done before .
and even at all .
now we go .
let 's go back to zurück again .
what is the most famous sentence in the film or out of the series ?
it can only give you .
thank you .
as if we had done that .
and that 's not true of my player .
they can do a lot of them .
there are so many different games .
just think of , , trinkspiele , und and so on and so forth .
and just so ist is the number of players .
and therefore there are lots of stories that everyone want to tell .
now the next question is , who is this ?
i have a fairly high opinion of mine .
i 'm going to think of physical intelligent and extremely creative .
but i know that a hundred institutions are more than just one , even if it 's mine .
so it came down to the idea that you put the sex with the creative process .
what if we ca n't just get rid of war and allow it , but even ? ?
so , as you say , we 're actually going to have to invite you to join the development of this problem with electricity .
imagine , for example , three , three , a auf that you find completely recently because they remember it for example .
they 're also a huge fan of . .
now , you can just do it now , with today of technology , that 's not so hard to make a difference .
and this store her on top of the hoch , where it ends up , and that 's really cool to me , that 's really cool .
that means that it 's not somewhere in between , but it goes down exactly where it wants to land .
really beautiful , we are in the internet .
and in the internet , you can really do everything .
so each medium is kind of action .
that means that they can write write , they can draw , whatever they want to do .
and if we look at this structure again , we look again .
this looks like a netz web , right ?
this is something that is built in common .
and i 'm really suggesting that the internet was born in order to tell this kind of stories .
it 's just not that many , even at least .
so now i 'm even going to go one step further , and i 'll leave the audience themselves .
that 's in a . .
that 's where the characters can fly from the series in the real environment against people who have these auf on their mobile phones .
well , hierzu on this , they also know they 're very good , they 're like mobile und and based .
these beautiful areas which just evolve very rapidly .
and i 'm not able to go into that because i would have two minutes .
we 're bending .
each of us are at three parts .
the first part is , , the second part is und and then we have the . .
with this stage , i was able to see the des of this , right , i have to figure out this : the innovation innovation überzeugen .
they gave me the first prize for best people .
and i have to say , this is a bestand , aus von from the , , und and so on .
so seriously people , you should .
and if i can get to convince these , this is where the internet is really trying to use beautiful structures of structures in the world , and i think i can really convince anyone .
so .
everyone 's at once . why is the whole thing ?
because even alone in this name are all werden .
so , of course , we 've got the : word : who is there , i 'm sure you are , everybody 's in .
of course , die .
in the event , very much died .
everyone 's going to say , everybody has to die .
and of course , everyone 's in the sense of everybody can come up if he wants this .
that 's completely important .
i 'm coming out of the und , and there is nothing worse in my opinion than if it 's going to be a wird .
i do n't know if you know it .
if you 're in the theater and then it comes like this , it comes into the und and all that : oh god , please do n't .
and it 's not .
so it 's transparent interaction .
and no one .
he can just be surprised .
the reason i 'm spreche is that the whole project is going to be too high , first .
that 's also a few reasons .
i 've been looking around this project , and i 've always been asked , `` do n't go in english , hey bigger , blah blah blah .
and i 'm just going to say , `` the german ist is the third of the world
the ist is english , then the transistor and then the german german .
now it 's not like we move in some small bewegen .
and also , i think , really , in fact , when it 's really really , other people like me is that people will be grateful for something that was not through any durchgedreht wurde , where the end of each und and every glattgebügelt of each worden has been .
if all of this goes out , as i 'd like to do this , the first stage is now the first zweitausenddreizehn online online .
and if you ask me now , why i 'm here today is at a , , where it 's under the cover of electronic läuft .
and i also did some idea .
i love . .
not just . .
i 'm also very sensitive by und and . .
a few waren were also there and . .
and i can only tell you that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and incredibly . .
but it does n't use anything if you do n't use it .
and my project is simple , and i just did anything i 've learned .
and it habe .
and so far goes .
i can just say .
so , if you think about it , i do n't want to take my part , i had a idea of charakter character , or i 've got a chance to say , `` i 've got no idea , '' and whatever it is .
you can find out on the internet .
on facebook .
that 's great , like the sprechen .
yeah , ' ' .
welcome to : you can make memories ?
question for them .
can you make memories ?
can you remember what 's going on in your life ?
have you forget more vergessen ?
who can remember who ?
there are no hands up there .
so you can make memories ?
apparently .
thank you .
no , it just does n't want us to do today .
then the talk would be pretty much quickly .
and good evening , my name is samuel . .
the talk today tonight , which i chose to do because he connect two of my favorites or my two great momentan right now .
i 've seen it up here in the distance of art , and i 've just done the bits of the bits and beschäftigt that would come up as big of the world .
and most of time , i 'm also as und and im in the private and a professional field .
so on the one hand , i 've been looking at the computer with very much , in the other hand , so i 'm in the middle of the human so'n bisschen'rumzuforschen , so how does this work that ?
how can you change this ?
you can do something like that .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , intelligence . .
so the question was : when can we , when can we build a computer that works like the human brain ?
so , and i think there are quite close to this .
so two , three hundred years , i do n't do that .
but let me just give you , why do n't you need a little bit like this .
so the comparison between the computer on the site and our brain on the other side .
if we take the computer , it 's all , it 's all , it 's all , it 's all , it 's like , it 's , , it 's , , and it 's all these cameras , and all of all , you know , all the smart movements of it in kleinen little .
it 's called , , processing . .
these pieces of parts are filled with a tiny transistors .
now the word is , everybody has heard , and in fact , it 's always going to be a frog .
the kleines little , , which has three und and entsprechend , or not .
in our computers , we have nachgeguckt vor about five hundred million of these small pieces .
and the da here is . .
we tend to do things , we have wireless things , we have ' einstein saying , you know , computer computers can be able to do it very much , very quickly , but it can be done for zero and one .
it 's more .
it 's actually quite accurate .
let 's compare the brain with our brain .
our brains , as a tiny satellite of the redwood , is that the vast and we have of it , we have , , 100 billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray mass .
but the nice thing is , our neurons do n't only have three connections , but they 've got to go up to pro per gallon .
and this makes a verbindungszahl von , just because it 's beautiful , it 's 10 trillion .
these are 10 with 14 zeroes . .
so , there you see the complexity of the brain is much greater than what we 're going to do right now .
if we want to compare the mal , maybe the one or another one , the first ingredient , which had had its own source of its power , is that the , , and with the der of the wurde , was called geheizt . .
and we also see our raucht manchmal , but the box here takes about 20 watts of magnitude .
and that is , and that is , the equivalent of two great pounds , so you do n't need it , you do n't want to get your computer up here .
now , if we look at the gigantisch extreme good part of this up here , we do n't use it , we do n't use why , why do n't we forget why ?
maybe you know what one or others knows in the internet , so the human being only is using 10 percent of your brain , they 're going to be able to get this um to become a brain brain .
and then , of course , the advertising is sich a little bit .
ten percent of it may , but our brain is obviously in the middle of our evolution to these mass , which is auch'mal small , completely in the middle of the middle , in the middle of the middle , and everything else has . .
that 's not happening because we do n't use it .
so why does it seem like us to let the biggest part of this lassen ?
maybe you do n't know the term of the ? ?
and i 'm going to do so close with the , , when you see the sehen in the ocean , then you go up on the sea , then the top is going to go down into the ocean floor .
and this 10 percent here , that 's roughly what we 're going to do is aber , which is prozent , is prozent percent , and it 's prozent percent , it 's a big ab . it 's a big ab .
we die the term we 're 're but but but . .
and , in fact , in the end of that memory , you might be aware of one or other people with gedächtnis memory .
people who live around a lot more detail than i do n't even have seen in the situation , and they say , `` well , what do you do ?
this is where there is a special , a special one , a savant , , so someone who 's auf in a field that is gutes in a plane , in a plane , in a plane , in a , , in a , , in a , , so quickly he 's in a plane , a plane in a plane , in a , , in a , , so quickly he 's in a plane , a plane , in a , , so quickly he 's in a plane , a plane , in a , , so quickly he 's in a plane , in a , , in a , , so quickly he 's in a plane , in a , , in a , , so quickly he 's in a plane , in a , , in a , , and so rome is now chinese . it 's not necessarily the smallest city , it 's got a huge sign of paper and started to get rid of peace .
and it 's not something that goes like this , and there 's no that , no , every single house , every single door , he has seen every single dog , he would have seen it , he could go back to paper .
so where does this come from ?
so why can that , why ca n't we do that , well , it 's probably very close that the bisschen mehr is the little one on its prozent percent .
now , we now use the answer , but why ca n't i remember the gestern last night in all the details ?
trade hypnotiseur von of mine made interesting experiences .
he once worked , for example , who worked with a war plan that had been completely , her experience , and that was n't even the case that the schutzfunktion vom of the brain , that 's not happening . that 's gone .
and that 's beautiful , so that 's very good .
now it 's about making people zu .
there she is , in a very safe meeting , to the end or after this event , even if they could n't remember it , they could n't see it , then they would see the des of the car , where those people were , , that was not , , that was meter feet .
and in fact , in this kindergarten of one of the great worden .
the second thing i did was , it was a lady in gehabt , who told me that her mother was always going to read her mother when she was singing , when she was small , so four years .
and they sat on top of her mother and her mother read .
and then he said , in malawi , she 's just singing .
then she started infected , she was four when that 's happened , she could n't read it , today she can .
and they said , `` tell me the . .
they actually found a bunch of roots in the 1970s where right on this side of the text is the lady .
so the brain is the same as it was , , the image .
he could read it .
so we actually have access to it , but we do n't seem to go in ordinary life to do things like that .
now now , we now do n't grow the event , but like gesagt said , he 's got a set of an image , one , one of the , , so that what we 're going to do is we 're actually going to have our jobs , so that what we 're going to do is what we 're going to do , what we 're doing , which is , what we 're doing , which is , what we 're doing , which is , what we 're doing , which is , what we 're going to do is to say what we 're going to do , what we 're going to do is to say what we 're doing , which is , what we 're going to do is to say what we 're doing , which is , what we 're going to do right now , what we 're going to do is , what we 're doing is , what we 're going to do is , you know , what we 're going to do is -- you know , what we 're going to do is , you know , what you 're
and , you know , it was n't a long evening evening , so they sit up with bequem , füße'n , bisschen little und , and then i can ask you , so , just close their eyes .
and remember a very , event in the recent past .
take the first what comes out .
and , if you do that now , perhaps you 're going to be familiar to that memory of memory .
you might get a picture , maybe even a movie ?
in some ways , it does n't just exist because we do so normal , but you do that for the first time .
and if you can see that , it can be either in the movie of their eyes , or as you can see yourself on a screen .
that 's what we call a call , the other thing .
thank you , you 're allowed to solve the thought that the eyes can open up again .
who 's got a visual information , a visual information ?
yes , there 's a couple of hands . there 's a couple of hands , which is that , the third third times i would say , yes , that 's about what i 've expect , it 's actually something that we do n't think so often .
so , go on to weiter .
but what seems beautiful is to pay attention to memory , when they , memories , it 's not just that memory , entsprechendes gefühl , is that we 're ein a positive event , and i can see the one or a other smile , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because it was beautiful , because you 're laughing , and you 've got the wrong still , actually , in our memory , in our memories , and you have a very beautiful one .
and here 's what 's exciting .
all the time was , well , that our brain does n't change any difference between what we actually remember , and what we 're just going to do is to imagine what we 're going to do .
now , you can try that if you sit down at home and you 're looking at something in the future that 's not happening yet , you 're going to get similar information like this , if you remember what 's going on in the past .
and , you know , you 've got to know those stories that you 've been talking about , you know , in a runde event .
back then , hey , there 's this thing and it was that , and that was so beautiful , and the longer the stories , the more the stories , was the ones , and the more likely it is that there was a lot of , , there was a lot of people , there was a lot of , , there was still a lot of money , there was still a lot of money .
so if we do that in terms of it , so if we can actually change our memories , why do n't we make it possible , do i ask it ?
, , when i came here , my uncle has shown me from his legacy in switzerland .
a very beautiful image , and it 's a very beautiful paradigm .
only , the picture is a little bit more beautiful than the wheel , and it 's funny freedom , it 's a little noch'n , because it 's a beautiful dog , because it 's a beautiful dog , there 's a beautiful dog , there 's a beautiful dog , there 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a picture of this blog , not not to help .
and why do n't we do that , in our own thoughts , our own memories , `` hey , what makes me feel like , if i do this more beautiful thing , what i 'm going to do so far ?
they actually have an artistic freedom in their own thoughts .
now , you know , you know , people do n't know so many people who you see in the morning , if you 've just seen so clean eyes , what 's going on ?
i was bad enough to me , and i was doing the whole thing through my head .
in fact , the whole night and the thought did n't give me anymore .
i think it 's the other way that he did n't go here .
the son freund friend of mine a little bit depressed when he came to germany , because his mother stayed in australia , and he just made her horrible .
so what it did is he made up with his son 's son , and she said , or she said , `` well , what was the most beautiful thing about today ?
which was because it was the most beautiful , you know , and then he got to tell him , it got him to tell him what a great thing happened .
and within two weeks , the son was . .
and then it was ok that the interface is getting away to come back .
and this is now the whole kind of youth we 've done with this , which is now one of the smartest people i know .
so it 's not the memories that affect us , as we are , it 's our focus on our focus on what we 're using .
and how much energy is going to continue or use .
so if you think of an'nem gedanken 's thoughts , or say that it 's , , that 's like this .
we do n't know what ' says , `` well , what beautiful , '' let 's look at it , ja , i mean , `` it 's got me ' , '' i mean , `` well , it was so beautiful , i mean , that was beautiful , yeah ?
and then take that one .
take this to your und , and let 's play it up .
or if you get someone ärgert , sei , it 's ihre your boss , or your wife , or your husband , lachen , you laugh .
so , just take this image , put it out of an fun auf .
so'ne gauklerkappe mit at , . let 's jump in the background ; she says , `` why do you laugh ?
because they imagine , because they are funny .
and you can do much better with the situation .
can the guy be happy ?
no , i think our brain has so much capacity for it to store everything .
but it does n't matter because we can choose free , how much we have the focus and how important we think , a memory , a memory , an idea , it comes on us .
my commitment to you , she , play with the images in your head , use the power of your und and give him every single day that their life needed .
good afternoon .
thank you for coming .
if i 'm going to ask a party , what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to do it in my work , and i 'm going to tell you with friends with friends with friends , and i 'm going to see color eyes , and in the spirit of my audience , the von of music , zeltstädten , und and auftauchen .
so if i , that it 's about a für for classical music , then sich von pictures of old people who are in right , long in räumen and very der of art .
frank sagte once told me about music to talk about architecture .
and that 's how things do what we do .
now , i 'm going to give you a glimpse of what i 'm going to do right now , and i 've brought you a short movie .

silence is rock'n'roll it .
that brings it from my view at the best time .
since it comes out , it 's going to seem to make a completely different time that 's completely like this .
we 're sind today , at the end of january , and we have very early in our youth , which is the incredible force and joy to classical music .
but also , we also have noticed that the des of the und and the uns will give us a little bit of joy .
and we are , in general , the so-called crisis of the traditional music is not in the content of the content , the music itself , but it 's in its liegt .
so let 's ask the question , how can we create a kreieren , that the music is close to the friends and the strength that we are so much in love .
how can we create a organisieren system that works beyond the origin of the world system ?
we put the threats that they know from the classic , space , time , light , context , in question .
so let 's take the relationship between the audience and musicians .
they normally have a conversation in the stage .
we 're trying to go together .
here you see a picture of our . .
the musicians are sitting in the audience , drink , , divide in the animal with the audience , stand up , play one , two pieces .
the whole thing will be a little bit of a . .
anyone who 's thought is , , comes on stage and goes back .
or this is in the concert .
it 's like , it 's like , it 's like , it 's like , it 's like , you know , when you get to go , it 's less easy , it 's kind of like you can , sit down and listen to look at it and listen .
but there 's music , there ca n't be quiet .
and we thought we 've got thought about how to do this .
and if you sit from them differently and you can put into a stück piece of music , you 'll listen to yourself .
so here is not one that we 've not had a meeting on the stage , and four levels to change the audience .
the audience would have . .
so at the evening , everyone was in the first series .
what 's important about us is that we 're not just doing any of the time , but that we think about music .
so , if we ask questions , what are the spaces and what we do is in the minds of people , the music is that it might be as much as it does ?
and so nachts night , at night 's night , in dreißig , , who are actually just kerzenlicht by erleuchtet , in north korea , in , , in old . .
but not just the spaces and the lighting can be alive alive and lower , but also the connection with others .
and so we 're very happy that we 've had a few years ago with the zusammen system that we 're working with , and they 're working with a few years , and we 're going to develop movement to music , which actually did n't have been written .
and so they get für for von or kammermusikstücke from steve rich .
and in this year we have one of us , if you will , erfüllt . .
so for the first time , we had a concert together with a umgesetzt .
we 've got the story of the soldiers from strawinsky mit with , , live-musik , und and animationsfilm .
and that really works , because we had a large hatten of these things that we put in this piece .
we 've got a lot of money over a lot of money from people out of germany so that we could do it .
at the same time , it 's something that comes out of a community .
we 're totally happy to have found more than in in in the city of london .
in the city , it 's so large that we find great spaces and exciting places for granted , but so small we 're curious .
if the first of the year in the van two weeks , aus aus are coming from europe in the city , it turns out that there 's more people in the city with more people than usually .
the whole employer is organisiert .
we sind are a mischung mixture of students and students , engineers , musik- , medientechnik , wirklich , vollkommen , really completely completely .
and there 's a ein , , which is like the oder and the und and funding in the eye , sich bis bis in a , , who take for a year .
also , it 's also , , but it 's a year , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , or the , , which are in absolute hands , and become going to be created by the peanut .
we all do in our play and live in all germany .
that means the biggest part of the work is going to come and on a . .
just three times a year , we spent over the year scale to a wochenende board , besprechen , which is the one or other problems that are infected , and also provide the amount of money that 's just relevant if you want to keep something in motion .
and finally , there are two to freiwillige volunteers apart that for some days or some weeks of their hands , and then they will be needed to take a few weeks , and they will be needed to help the help , the , , the , , the , , the . .
and of course , in these ancient days , the musicians come to them .
now , you could be able to mean that you could take anything that you need for a braucht .
but our geht goes forward .
we 've got that in der , in the city , a large community around us that we 've given us to do what we want to do
this is from the classic los walk , but also of all sorts of work like , for example , we have a baker , which is with bread oder or a , that is fresh food .
it 's going to take the wird in an order in the city over the city .
up to the . .
we 've been able to find a whole bunch of lives that are going to give us their place , so that they can give musicians there .
and in that way it 's going to be a zu in this town , and from the people in this town .
they identify in a very special way , to the extent .
so in the beginning of the year , we were able to put von support people from the citizens to live out there , which is now the whole auf of a und and trägerstruktur stellt .
we vom out from the board that classical music is going to send it into the right hands .
that 's why we 're incredibly happy about that , in fact , that in fact , this is going to take place in europe ,
now , if you 're still going to do that right now , the feeling of traditional music is like this , you just get over .
in the beginning next year , we 're back to und , and we would be happy if they are there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learning .
you might think you might know .
i 'm talking about trying to learn or the effect of learning , but i mean , for learning , we 've heard a lot more , and it 's also ren rungen sammeln and gewinnen .
you know , experience books , a beautiful barrier for the . .
what i 've learned from art and culture , is that i can say a lot of natural of this because it is exponential beite i 'm in that field .
and that 's why i think it might be right to give you a little bit of a ein , a different kind of noch , which is my talk .
art is beautiful , it makes a lot of work .
they also have a laugh now .
you can always get the laughter laughing though most of you know it .
so why is that ?
i think it 's going to do that in the word of the word of something that we can do right now .
art , which we can do sometimes is what happens .
in work , we say the real thing that we do .
sometimes anyway .
people like to work that , this is what it 's about me .
but in work , we do n't think about the und and the art to the rich level of life , where we move to our experiences , our own thoughts .
and so , what i 've been doing is i 'd like to leave you now , in about three hours a little bit of living in five games that all have the courage to start with one thing to start with it .
it starts with the , , for childhood , going on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not going to tell everything from my youth , do n't worry , it 's going on . the word i 'm going to tell you why i 've taken this for my genommen .
the interaction for the first part of my professional life and then finally , five , . .
and one of you will know that it 's going to know these pieces of sebastian de bach .
, , und and . .
you learn it in the first two , three years ago , and i 've done a lot of time .
and so 10 , 11 , i put these little together , on the piano , not far from here in the , , at home .
these are the pieces of . live .
there will be a tune , and the other voice , , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is at the same , but it is . .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something a little bit about the art that it can do , and if it only only two voices , it 's possible to think about whether it 's the same , the future , the past , the images , the images , in , , in , , things that are sind in the moment that makes it art .
and i learned two , , sometimes also three , to the inventionen , to play at the same time , to hear any kind of a , that does n't .
that was what i learned .
another experience , i never forget , and i 've had the worry that i might probably be able to do this .
i have michael , , and there are more people in the room than today , and in the middle of the kam came out .
i was forgotten .
i played .
so again , back to the same one , i did n't even know .
the audience has more fast than me , because i went to my place in all of my place , made my notes , put it up , and started the third one .
and they do n't believe what they 've got behind me .
but it was a very heavy experience .
maybe it was one of the experiences i knew , well , with iran , although i was going to get a hatte , if i could n't go to my gehen , because at least , we can cheat easier .
yeah , the next chapter of my career , i 've been mit with inspiration and i 'd like to tell you stories .
when i was so war , i went to my und and i said , mr. , , i 'd like to play a spielen .
and he said , `` well , that 's not .
because they have to have many of them and have a lot of experience about women .
now imagine , a jungen young man , so young , like a sentence .
i do n't forget that .
and from that point , i 'm . .
in the meantime , i was the study of this .
i interviewed , and i remember myself in a situation i 've never experienced .
it was the von of von 's und , and now i come to the part of work i just did n't care , and she was with the most beautiful , you had to do the arms , and then it went back again and again again .
i 'm not going to play it now . i 'm not going to give a car here and i could n't do it .
i played this one , and i got this one , and i got it , and i got it right .
and then i played them up and , , and i played myself into a gespielt , and i only know that i suddenly moved to the ground and fall at all .
i was worried .
i had n't had anything , nothing took , and the music did this with me .
a experience , where i learned , emotions also help .
and sometimes it 's really true to work on that , you know , you 're going to do it in these hineinkommt in in these condition , and i call it myself .
where everything goes from .
we actually had this situation in the zweitausendzehn in in an organization .
and then almost anything like that , when we did it , it took only two months a day , where they would usually have a week .
well , these were my ideas with me in the piano , with calculus , with synthetic work .
and now , to my fellow , . .
i was first a first time as a musician , but just as a . .
we played gespielt , klavierquartett , . .
i gave gegeben , and i was so interested in my für for the music on the music .
in the choir , in the choir , breathe , a singen child , wonderful experiences that made me very , very much .
and then a point like that , where i went to in in the theater theater , in the und and the , , and i was doing this , with überschrieben , , that phrase because there came to this idea , or this idea , from this combination of art , of culture , i was then auch gerade in the eingetreten , politics and law .
which is the art , culture , to make it into my work .
so today for art , but it 's not as artists , but , you know , it would n't say to be , , but it would be as a weiterzukommen and a half .
i was there in the theater , and in fact , in germany , there was no fighting in the germany in germany , only in tokyo , and i was working there , and there i was going to have more with this question , what can you do to make art to make art to better , to improve the wounds of art , to create a good strategy , a good strategy ?
and that was the reason i 'd love , in my run , in the direction of this , , and with a jahren and a half years ago , and then i was . .
but before i was a different , , and this time , i was mit with interaction .
kam came to german städtetag .
the german hat has his in in . .
i 'm a , , although sometimes in my , , because i was born in geboren , and i was always steht , which i was doing , i do n't have that kind of ausmerzen .
but i have a wurzel root , because my grandparents were also kölner , , and there , in , , i 've seen the erlebt .
this was something i was doing something more of what i did n't do so , and all of a sudden , i got involved in a different form of culture into a , , into a culture that was living in the middle of people in this apparat device .
as soon as we get away , all of us were in a completely different condition ,
and i then , with dieckmann , , who was finanz- and nordrhein-westfalens , , who was my friend and school , and then we always made up the abend of my friend , and he was doing , `` i always got another one else , '' for instance , for example , i could have alles-hat-ein-ende-und-nur-die-wurst-hat-zwei me .
we 've done the herzbuben gemacht , so , of course , on the other hand of the umgedichtet , geübt . .
and that , that came really out of the people .
and it was my destiny that i learned at least für für for my lernte , and i did n't care about the wall .
i love at the next day , i had confused , , oh , the wall is like , yeah .
and i quickly listen to some questions on some questions .
and from there i was für for the cities in the factory .
and so , again , i 've experienced how to communicate like these interactions between two german cultures .
in fact , we 're talking about the same language , the music is too wonderful and becoming beautiful , but much became , , . .
in other words , it was n't about people else , but it was a lot of them on top , and this is what i found as a large , to experience , to experience , like the german identity , and i 'll go back again , and the german dann , and these two states hat .
since then germany is . .
and on time , there is a lot more platziert places .
so by interaction , i 've learned all the things that i learned in the city .
we had das that , by the way , that i had a , , so i started here when i started here , stand , stood up in my dezernent for culture and in .
i still have that .
in addition for , , you could n't write dezernent for culture and . .
i was the first des of the . .
so i did n't have that much so much , though it was wonderful that i had this hatte , but it disappeared , because i was involved in it for education , and it could make peace to education and design .
we do a lot of work on the industry , and we 've only seen that if it 's only this paradigm between , and und and sehen , what we 've made here , the erleben experience , where you can experience interactions between work and architecture , from the zum to the top of the blue . .
many , many and many , we could do that , and i 've been able to do that , and i 've experienced what this means if there was different people out of different areas .
you remember , by the way , that i 'm going to get more of the art of art , of more and more to culture that we care , that we 're going to have the zwischen between people , between cultures , between communities , better , to look at it , and i 'm going back to art .
so , interaction was also between the das of the subject as us , sieben , seven die of the idea , at least 2,000 , that could allow the europas of europe .
but this last chapter , this fifth dome has yet is yet . .
now , this word has two , , and one of the things that i 'm trying to do is to give me something , and i can use it to something , and i can use it as a symbol and say , `` i know something that means , i know something .
it 's always in its . .
i know something that you can do with your , , so i say i 'm going to make you or the community .
and i mich with something , if i 'm und and say , that 's what i want to recognize .
and that 's a very big deal .
five key to three million people are trying to move , to move , städte cities , to identify and to realize that you 're a community 's in europe .
so as big , we 've called genannt , but anyway , as a community of many people living in a large life of life and yet at least a common language , even though nationen nations are here , and this was our more important to bei the people and of course , of course .
at ethiopia , in the '50s , in many other experiences .
a experience from the hab have not been that many people .
there are nowgorod und and food , two schools , and young girls from , , dem aus , dem aus , from , , and young students from a schule school , from nowgorod , , who have died from people , young men , from zu to a play process that is home , the home , their love , love and death .
and there 's been a special effect that young girl died from young zitierten und , and he von von von russen russen , and he said , `` young men died from germany in some deutsch town .
and there was one of these young men in the phone , and playing the , that i loved .
and then , he er out of a letter , and he said , `` i 'm a , , he wrote him at home , as a young town that he played , and i could never play a spielen , because my two fingers are just sind .
and he seine his fingers with a , , sich the piano in this game , and tried to play the zu .
and it was n't .
it was such a szene ship that i would go back after that , and said , what did we learn ?
we 've learned that a lot of people can move together , but all of the things we 've learned is we 've learned that we were in frieden years in frieden and peace , and culture us so that we do n't want to be the head , because we 're talking different languages that we can identify ourselves to us .
and so for me , this was an amazing experience , and you see it 's not just about learning something .
it 's learning to learn something and to win .
and if we 're doing a lot of furniture and invention , if we allow us to inspire ourselves from art and culture , our own position , in the same with the process , if we interact and also start working on our own identity and we finally start to let us go to art and culture .
and i hope you 'll have a lot of und and haben that you 're going to move out of this .
thank you .
yeah , thank you .
i think we 're waiting for the first picture .
so i 've got a couple of slides for support .
but it 's not a scientific show , but it 's in my hier process here , to find a direction and a theme of where i think is the next few years .
so , through the most powerful words i know , thank you for what ted means , and i think in the area of können , we 're able to be able to push this talk .
and then i had heard that you should think of the talk in english when somehow possible , but , if you look at it , you see , you would n't understand what i was going to say in english , i did n't go right much to how i was going to say , and so i was going to talk to you about the talk .
how we 're going to die .
i have to tell you about erzählen .
war was a patient in the hospital where i was the betreue and was . .
she was about jahre years old , and she always love to get in love , because she remembered her to her man who was the first man in war .
and so every year , it 's a first time to dance , and it 's got a long time , and probably und a bowle zu , too much , and it 's und , and it 's und , and it 's on the right side , you can see that , the leg , the . .
a few years before , she was still und and had in the same chance that the left was broken .
and at that time , i was also as a doctor , and i have seen how she was being treated in trouble , as she was treated , and she was treated , and the discussion , as she was , is this really different ?
does it make sense , in a way so old people do these powerful technologies to do this ?
so , to , , on to demand , is that a human risk of people is there ?
and she 's hidden .
five years later , i come into the hospital , looking at the name , and i can tell you why it 's just so rare , too time in the time , and the dance in may put the other leg .
so that 's what the question is , what are i going to do when i talk about how a human deal is to decide what he 's put in his schreibt , or what he 's going to do on a ausfüllt basis ?
and that 's a little bit of a conversation .
you see the des of the one as we die .
it 's a book made by , , as we 're going to work , a report with .
and then it was , the globalization was very strong , so that you 've asked how could you go to work with it ?
you 've got it , and you can read it in this book , and i said it 's going to come up , so that 's going to come through the parts .
it 's going to be an extension of work , and it will also be much more for work for instance to china , which was a huge issue .
and that 's also , in fact , the work of the individuals , of course , , a little bit , , a little bit , , that he has always been more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
and that , for me , who are just going to get less care of their work , and more and more of a small wurden of life , where it was about to have a lot of wertschöpfungen wertschöpfungen , and no more reason through his work .
and now , if we push it into a und and medical area , then , of course , there 's a movement .
you know , if you hear television in your television , which is what doctors do , married and am most , , then the so-called . .
and it 's not something else , like it needs to be here , what you have made it to do it , it 's ist , so it 's time , and if it is n't , then the medical service is also going to be able to do these care of care and the medical treatment .
and by this wird , however , the work of immer is increasingly more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and using use of personal faith , in the background against an , , und and . .
now , a good friend of mine went to me because he was n't wanted this to be a praxis practice , has the und , and has moved to the und to become a doctor for the doctor .
and the sind are mostly a piece of work , and he 's like , the martin , the family , had shown that there were more old people between the , , the hospital , the hospital , and back back , because the nicht do n't even know what to do if it was bad to people .
and then they come up into the hospital , going back into the stream , or , , and then they 'll be there .
and this computer , he thought , is that if there was such a little bit of in , then i 'd like to go out there to make a little bit of something that you can get out of this cycle of the und and the other von of people .
now , in chicago , he had to find it , after he had learned the language of a lot of times that there was exactly the same thing in which we had happened .
it also will have been a world 's eingeführt .
it 's no longer the , , the most important , but it 's also einmal in one way , so i do n't want to be werden , or not in the hospital when i 'm in bin .
and then it becomes . .
it 's like , on the third days , a conversation has a conversation with the availability of it , and that is , you know , i want to go back to the hospital , or i do n't want to be in the hospital when something happened .
and that 's exactly what i want to be copied with , or i do n't want to be
so this data goes to a central , and there 's that doctor in , , has always sich the vor , and then you can get the decision on this .
now , if we look at zurückdenken , which would love to be war and also war , and we imagine that they would n't have werden a geschrieben , and i would n't like to get rid of that , so they would n't have this second dance in may where they would go back , and then they would go back with a needle .
and there 's my friend , which is that there in chicago , very much more of what he 's supposed to do with it .
so the last thing is that today is a little bis to prozent percent of people not to die at home , but in hospitals , to hospitals , and that this is also true , so that you can not , not the ideal form of living systems are for old people , but it 's often a typical kind of eng , da da , and the financial industry and a lot of the an , to my perception , to my perception .
there are also prototypes that are doing a very good deal , there are very menschen people that get there , but when i look at the anschaue , and we have about patienten patients in the year , so about five , six , which may be coming out of zu to us , then i would say it 's really difficult to help where we need to do it , and his inner boxes .
the whole thing , of course , has been clear , is that all of the resources that control control is because in the last half of the money that money is not enough for the money to care , that all people who care about , or the medical security , that the people who get care of care or the medical security is so paid that they say that i 'm good with , because i can give a family of food with one or two children .
now , this is just not the reality , but you do n't need two im in your und and you do it all the time .
this is a view of the quality of people as a result of the growing market that you want to protect , it seems to be the individuals .
and now , i 'm going to come up with this , which is maybe what you can do in the past , i mean , `` well , '' i 've got to ask you , and i 've shown you , so that 's just the situation .
and that 's where i just saw the hervorgekramt und , and the article give me there , because i think a society , i think , also needs to be as these structures , to the existing structures that we put together what 's going on in our society .
and in the course of an article , it 's because of the people .
and the second sentence here is to protect up on top of the second problem .
and what i 'm often sometimes is there is a third sentence in there , that every single one of them should have a chance to protect it .
because this is a way to get to aus out of this kind , and i will give that to others , and that 's what i 'm going to give me kind of , and i 'm going to give you something like i 'm going to die .
because the last thing is , even if we do n't like this issue , we 'll come from the point .
hopefully , hopefully , with a hundred or . .
and so , of course , that 's what my job job is to say , the message i want to give you each and is i want to ask you , but at some point you 'll have to ask the issue , and if it 's going to give you the subject , and if it 's going to be so far or either if you 're , , oder or ist , it 's going to be even late to be in life near the life , and i want to think about that question .
now , if you think about it , what makes it would mean , then , you will go to dots where , in the last direction , what 's going on in the past , what are the five major things in my life ?
there 's a book now , which is quite vogue .
and of course , it 's natürlich , it 's the friends that i have , that i 'm going to talk to me that i 'm going to talk about , and that 's what they know about life , it 's the . .
it 's certainly the trust between people that i may be able to do , in the oder or in the bereich condition or a lawyer or a oder or a oder or a different one with whom i happen in relationship .
and it 's there many times a lot of factors , and i do n't go through all of them .
but if you look at these three dots , then you 've got a whole bunch of tasks in your life where you might have to live on your own life in your own life .
and then another thing that 's going to come out is that we 're going to experience a certain set of erleben experience , so i would take this one as a text or as an example of that .
other people can find decisions for all these decisions and behavior , which , in fact , nicht .
that 's my inner condition .
it can only come from us .
so it 's not the question of what 's going to be different for me , who will be me going to give me because i 'm going to eat , or is , or can i use who 's on me ?
but it 's the same thing to ask , where can i think about people , where i can , and my life would be able to share with these questions and make me und and care .
and if you say how we 're going to work , these things have been taken into these societies that have been left from the outside of the outside , it 's a way to say , i 'm going to give me my life of being of this .
because no human can touch me , as i can myself , i want to see it .
and i do n't have to be able to put in general oder or concepts that say you 've got to have a ausfüllen camera , and because you 're so old , imagine whether you 're going to want to be werden , whether you want to be werden .
and these are the questions that i 've been in the past just to be used to vorarbeit bearbeiten .
so , this would be an inner property that is in the deep condition that is in me and who ca n't protect it from the outside that the state may not protect , but that 's not a law of law , and that i can also get other people to other people , and i 'm more confident , if i was n't there to myself who i have in front of them , so that 's what i am for a human being .
and to put these conversations , you need it to fly spaces , and that 's where i call this talk so , and here we call this talk so , and here we 've got these talk , and here we 've got the talk so , and here we 've got these kinds of talk , and here we are , in front , like the in in food , that 's what i 've been trying to do here in a picture , wo , and where we need to think about these kinds of issues , where a binary space is , so it 's not clear that it 's not too obvious , but that 's where a conversation is there .
so when we 're old , we can be able to say , well , a dance is in may , despite mine , maybe not very high age , that would be what happened .
thank you for listening .
wonderful good evening .
i 'll give two things .
if you give the first part to flat , you feel a little bit of a .
it 's another second .
let 's start with an .
that 's stupid , not .
what do they mean by that ?
is there different ? ?
or is predictable enough ?
yeah .
that 's not good if there 's one thing .
so , in fact , but i 'll just leave it for those who know it .
we do n't .
we only look at a single one .
and i 'd like to give you a little bit of a . .
, , kennen , we do we know what we 're going to do , we 're making ourselves to know .
and it 's really for the um to von von .
if we 're in the jungle , we are two , , where one of the things we have is that one of the other people .
we know that , again , we 're looking into the box , which is small , it 's three and it 's three people .
we can zoom in any amount of the same number of elements ?
so , how would we make it ?
that means that we would only , the people , one , two , three , we 're getting the three , and see three of them , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and wonderful .
what do you mean , yes ?
nice .
this works in times wonderful , which works in large numbers , even though it . .
but it does .
how do you count it ?
how do you realize that as many people are there ?
and i understood , and people did n't know what else .
lassen .
you name it !
you know , it 's clear , it 's not , now we 're in the everyday room , and it 's also understanding that .
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , you know , it 's eine a und and it does n't work , right ?
you put one , you put on a chair , from the mouse .
the next , , the way that 's going to take the next stage , is it 's possible to get different people , not a chair , and the number are just big , okay ?
now we 're going to zoom in .
how can we overcome two powerful numbers ?
we 'd say it 's such a large or bigger or bigger than the other .
we could do it ?
we 'd like to start .
right ? that 's wrong , because the point is that if you start in an infinite meeting , you start to count , yes , i would just say it 's not to others .
, , ist , is obvious , right ?
so how does it go ?
slits ?
no , ! !
she did exactly that .
tasty !
so now let 's look at that .
mind , it 's always bad , yes ?
you see , you 're looking at no end , yeah ?
the point is that you do it very simple .
so , for example , if i take nehme , natural numbers , wir , we need to get rid of zero , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we 'd say , `` well , let 's take a copy of this und , and take away from this copy that we 're going to go for an infinite amount of zahlen numbers .
left numbers : okay , zero , two , four , eight , ? ?
okay ?
all right , all right , are auf on the infinite level of the natural numbers , but on one band , the , , on the other hand , are the straight and the drauf .
let 's tell you a lot of der of the bottom numbers we call the other amount of der of the natural numbers .
what do you think ?
is binary powerful , is it bigger than , , just big or smaller ?
right ? big ?
but that 's very rare , yes , in which we do n't have the . .
who is another estimate ?
small ?
who is bigger ?
ah , it does n't really have a plan , yes ?
that can not be true , yes ?
you ca n't even figure out what 's missing , bigger , it does n't work , right ?
okay , you say a little bit smaller ?
would you guess ?
that 's surprising what you need is , of course .
and now i now explain why the number is the same .
how does it work ?
right .
yeah , we train .
that 's the point .
we train .
we 're taking the zero from the distant amount , and we 're taking the zero from the natural crowd , raus .
the next of zero , to come up two , after the zero is coming , and i 'll get to a . .
the four , the two , the six , the three , the eight , yes ?
you can also analyze this , then it 's going to be free , that 's obvious , right ?
and what 's completely clear is that , by the way , this is what i 'm going to do is what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to do it in the conversation in the fashion .
and one of the things here is , there 's only the straight line on there , and the band is in the long time , right ?
we die the natural space of the space , die , ungeraden , and the band is still a long long .
that 's only in . .
so , if you want to explain what we 've learned today , we 've learned a lot , you know , what 's scary , i just finally finally ?
it 's an infinite amount of a property , which is that there 's only a property , and that 's basically not yet , and it 's charakteristikum , it 's absolute , , a real fan that is exactly so big .
that 's what they do n't . they do n't do what they call three three people , and then there 's only one there and there was three .
yeah , we 've done mosquito .
is n't that a ? ?
okay .
then we 're going to do a second one .
the conditions , the whole one .
here 's what brought up here .
in this experiment i 'm sure , it 's going to know at least one third , and it will make you feel that it 's made it , yes ?
so we call the doors a , b , c .
i 've hidden behind something , i hope you have n't heard it .
and you should be familiar now .
where do you mean , i 'm wearing something left behind a , b or c ?
guess , here , our , , here .
they react to be c .
who 's got another idea ?
a ?
who has another idea ?
i mean , obviously , b , b has no , it 's not the case , right ?
that 's right .
it really does n't matter , so you do n't have to go to the three letters and i 'm going to do one .
it 's really not matter , yes ?
it 's completely clear because it 's the chance that they have the same happiness , it 's because of a third .
, , there are three things ; it 's really not really matter , yes ?
now i 'm going to do that . i just do one .
good , i know where it is .
, , this is one of these guys .
so , i know where it is , and how it is , and it sounds , or whatever you call it , it goes into a second round .
so i really am the curious now i 'm doing now now right now .
so it 's like we go into a second round .
now , suppose , i mich myself to the one .
so , now i have to show a door , behind it does not exist , and they 're not saying .
because , if you say b , and i say and i know it 's not behind b .
then there would be no second round .
then i say , , from the mouse , gehabt .
but i have to say , this is , .
so i 'm only able to get a , behind which it does n't just have it , but what they did n't have said .
now the question is , and this is the common one , under the hier , under the condition that b is open , and it 's not here , you have your last chance to guess new .
you can now be at a stick , and then i 'm going to do it .
i 'm doing this on what you want .
or you say i 'm making c .
now , the question is , is it the knowledge now ?
, , very beautiful , b is up , now i know it 's a c .
or , but , thank god that b is open , i just wanted to stay at one , that 's it .
or if you say , it 's , , we have , , we have , , we only have two doors , and now it 's impossible to change or stay .
what do they mean by that ?
it 's not .
deworming .
why is n't it ?
nice .
why is it that it 's ? ?
yeah , exactly , that 's wrong .
it 's almost like if we had einstudiert hätten ne , right ?
but that 's how they 're , sind . they 're a new one .
so , the thing is , the thing is easy , yeah .
this is what all of you that i do n't know , six and , yeah , i 'm not going to have a jahren ted , otherwise , i ca n't have to look at it anymore .
well , it really does everybody .
behind the door it 's a third door .
and it 's always a third behind a door .
they can figure what they want , they have two liegen in the oven .
that means , you could do it on two doors , and you do n't know that if you do it in machen , you can put it on two numbers , then it 's , wenn , if you , the zero , that 's all in real life .
but here we have one door .
so , it 's like , two thirds is not what you might think .
so the two ocean here , but it can only be behind a door .
they 're not .
so what is more important ?
no way . i really got it on !
so what 's more important now ?
it 's better to stop , right ?
now it 's easy , yes ?
yeah , of course .
so that 's not hard , right ?
ha !
so what do we see ?
they 've been gehabt .
why ?
simple , even two thirds are not 100 percent : the difference between theory and practice .
i hope it was for everybody .
thank you .
mr. , , she said to me , for example , dranlassen dranlassen der , who just und out of bad food and poor food and thousands of people , the sell one was completely completely .
but i ' my best that all of this is going to come back to it again .
i 'm coming out of bauernhof farm , and i knew until i was 12 .
that 's what they have .
yeah .
thank you for today today .
i grew up close here .
and i do n't know if mr. auch came up to ask me if i want to talk to the ted to the lake , and i want to talk about a particular topic .
i have rausgesucht : : the issue trust .
yeah , motivation is not bad , and i am listening to the wife of the woman who said , maybe the one or some other mehr .
just to have full of that .
so today , for example , that 's now bei a lot of time now , but i do n't have to go tomorrow in this case because i was in three weeks at the juni june , at , , from nach to fahren , and you want to drive with a fahrrad bike , which is kilometer miles .
in other words , the training of the training does n't invent me .
so , to get rid of , you know , `` well , you know , you go to , , you go tomorrow and los , '' you all told you .
i said , `` okay , i 'm ' ' heut about the subject .
and i started a lot of , .
no matter , it 's a little bit , a little bit of , , the blind
i was really thinking about it in a moment when i was a bin , how would i describe the best ?
so , i come out of a thousand village with six houses , a lot of , , some und and my parents on the square , there 's apple , , und and - -- and what makes you from : : beer .
trust , of course , in sports , of course , not in the sondern but to me , und and beer .
why do i tell the story where i come from ?
so to me , one of the most important stories that i really do is i 'm really going to come from the country , from the village and there i grew up with two big names with the oldest brother , the ist .
and with the second brother , the same woman 's as me .
so the point is happening and dark , and i can also see where fenster windows in space , whether it 's light or from .
what 's very practical is for the home .
that , or we both can be able to see if we can be anything .
the bottom pole , but i 'm always going to tell you , i ca n't tell you , it 's mann .
the theme of the old men , . .
it 's always going to come up .
and what 's always important for me is , of course , the fact that you see , how do you trust trust , and you get this big confidence , the , that we all need to have more of a kind of situation situation .
and that was , for my parents , that they were like many of you , before my brother , and i did n't know a church .
we were so the first ones that happened in their lives .
and then they had to get something like this .
and now , it 's a great assumption that my parents would not have all the day of the day to stand with us all the time and say , there 's a wand wall , there 's a , wall , there 's a , wall , and you can get it back and feel fühlen , where you 're . .
a woman would have been -- we have home .
and b , our parents , from the beginning of view of us , is to go out of where our own brother is .
so , in the house , in the house , hoch- und and , , it also . .
that 's where the blind brother came with me with a spielzeugtraktor hof geschoben geschoben geschoben .
the gap of the shape , i still have .
and this is how the big brothers -- these are n't just good for the weak , but it 's also for the people .
and our brothers and my brothers and i , and i , you know , it 's really so everything outside us , and what they were able to do is to do just for example .
and this is what the bruder brothers started with text , and then at three years and then we wanted to be , of course , michael and i .
and then finally , with zu , like many little children , the bissl zackiger . .
until we can do that .
but we 've started doing this with , , at a moment .
and then the big question is : how does it take stones ?
and as you trust the trust , the world 's trust is that the children also fall back at the time in the back of the week and the und and the other one of us , we 're not wo where it 's driving .
and our solution was that , of course , we 've told a unseren of our parents , where are the , , so where there 's a car , where there is a car where there 's a car , where anhänger , , where you might have any kind of sachen stuff , which is , you 're not going to get out of this stuff -- that 's where we are .
and we needed to bring in between us in terms of the one , but the other is listening .
and you can do that now do n't all test , because otherwise it 's going to be so loud that you do n't have anything about it .
but ' ' night , if you look at the light , and you have in your bedroom , or in your bedroom , and you want to help .
you can try to try and find just klickgeräusch mit with your tongue , and you 're going to realize that in humans , people like bats -- they 'll hear a success .
so as the bats are doing this as well , the wand wall , the sound is just different wird .
and that 's for me in trust , so trust is also the movement , always important .
but möglichst are hohe absicherung , and safety , i have a chance of opportunity to help me come up there .
and i 'm just ohne without big trouble and clear , also without many accidents that you have , of course .
what i 'm talking about today is not a couple of pictures that i think is very selber about one of our auch .
that 's on the higher building of our higher buildings .
i 've written this : it 's also growing up with a vielfalt diversity .
and that 's what i 've been , very literally , because i 'm a person who has too much in the und and the mit with trust on the scientific side , i 've never heard of one thing , or i never am as sorry as i 've seen .
now , the never way to read it was also more .
but also , it turns out to do that , of course , it 's not for any fun experience .
now , the diversity of all of our power is to tell us that we know , in the process of our brains , to know where i am good , what did i create talent and where can i actually really do so much in my life ?
and our brother just came back , which has michael and me kept on a roofs of the house .
so then i said , okay , we 're hier .
you can see there somewhere from the individual window of the zum for example .
and the eyes went around , michael und , and i probably probably played a little bisschen on the girl .
but last , who 's going to stay down ?
i do n't .
and i realize that the other people , we are the generation of the young women there .
and of course , i 'm always on .
and then the consequence was that we had all three dachfirst oben sitting up on the ground and the father with anhänger mit and no longer knew what he 's going to do .
because trust , of course , is going to go away when other answer .
so , the father said , `` for god 's sake , help , help , help , help , help , the danger is relatively big , that one of us would have been hätte and zweifelsfall -gekullert , -gekullert , - -- i do n't know -- somehow wäre .
but never happened .
he then had to be so , that he had zurückgelotst us again , or vorausgeschickt hat , who then kept on .
and that was what i found most amazing that we had these possibilities .
but sure , not worry , that 's not a , , it 's not necessary to make later later .
for me , the different kind of family i was always important in my life , everyone who were interesting .
and most of all , they were all supergut , because i could also see , where i said , `` well , '' i was like my limits , which are the way i think they are .
so to guten good , i could never be able .
that 's what i did .
and i 'm not going to go to . today .
i 'm going to go out now out of rain today .
now it 's not at five degrees like this .
and at regen rain -- but still more than the inside .
but i 've always been able to tell you the trust of my strength that i was trying to do different research .
so , for example , for example , the first
and that was quite beautiful , because there was the queen who had to put us in this room , and said , ok , we 've got rid of kinder kids , but we 've got to give friends a few blind children .
in fact , it 's good because there 's going to be a way to each other .
and then you see what the other power is .
and there was always the big trust , and of course , if i do the funding for a long time , it 's hard to do because the other one 's what i 'm doing .
so it 's only a method , and this is the trust of my parallel .
in the other hand , a foot put a foot into the stellen , , and i put myself down , and then it 's in the back and the advertising is over , because that 's the full star .
i do n't try to try here here .
i was so aber .
i think it 's a little bit of . now .
and i would n't like to do it now , right now , right now ?
deworming .
sorry , i 'm ' .
okay .
and the next thing for me is this one of the most important thing to me , when i was a journalist in school , then the und and was . .
my parents were home , they were up to today , and they were also known to us as children .
but for me , in school , i was very important to do , how can i take much too much for school to get my molecular energy ?
and that 's where i had an opportunity to make in school .
and even though i was always thinking , this is all this bissl boring , because is is this one for the eher , ' i am .
and i thought , `` oh , i do n't have any more . ''
i said , `` well , let me do with a . . ''
and then the first thing started , the person , again , this is the big diversity here in the sports , because you need braucht , you need power , you need to have the power , you need the power , you need it to be good , and it 's extremer great .
- -- you 've got lots of your work in your work .
that 's what it is like .
you 'll only get quickly , if you just have the full trust in your own technology .
so if you have this trust in your own power , the power is that you can also , at any circumstances , in the same condition , at the same time , at the same time , you can get it on for a level .
and if you put in my case , trust the team .
because as a , , that does n't look at all , i 'm auf'n . .
and i 've never seen anything like now -- i 've got to use the word -- my - -- there 's only one -- it has been a practice for me .
does n't matter . we 'll do it again .
i 'm going to ask you now what i 'm going to do now .
and with one thing , one of them gave you another practice .
what i 'm always going to do is , what i 'm doing is , what i 'm doing is , what i do is , it 's the practice that i 'm telling the audience to tell you how it is that if you do n't see what it is like if you do n't see what it is like if you do n't see what it is like if you do n't see what 's going to do with a stundenkilometer'n . .
in isses ja , you 've got two peaks in your hand .
so , sure , i 'm not going to give you a hand , otherwise i could take my blindenstock and feel the ertasten .
not .
so i have to help myself .
so i came up with my dabei that i was looking at .
and it 's telling me the voice .
so it 's always going to get out of the ansagen .
and this is important for trust .
so the smell in communication , which is in the . .
and the sagt says , `` i 'm always , , '' when the geht is going to tell me und and an , who says , `` left on 11 , '' i know it 's easy to left , so on the upper part of the lakota watch with birth .
if he says , left up 10 , left to the left , and when he says , right to 10 .
okay , everyone understood ?
then natürlich'n problem problem because it 's got to get back again , or i 've got to find it again , i know it 's not .
and for me , it 's very big , critical , if the vor of me is looking at me , i must actually have to say to the really completely um about it .
to say that a positive thing , it 's for me the tools that allows me to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it quickly , and it 's also faster than others that start at the same store .
and that 's what i can only , if i create it to you , with two arms i , , to stand on a leg , and i 'm really going to have to make the eyes -- ha ha -- or maybe it can open up , it 's not .
and then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then the other leg
also with high shoes .
yeah , and that 's really important to me , when i 'm at bin , i 'm about to say , `` i 'm going to tell you the guy , so i say , `` oh , because i 've actually had the men as a hatte , '' how do i give it to say that i 'm going to say , `` hey , you 've got to do the right thing to say , because that 's because it looks like .
so that 's not what he needs to say .
so i 'm the one that needs to open up the path of communication .
and this is like in every . .
if somebody does n't know my need , he ca n't help me , but that 's because i 'm asked , and i 've got to say , well , i need one of you to have the curve , maybe bissl früher .
or i need you to tell you about how long the mountain is still , because if we scale the hochfahren , you 'll think about it . now it 's got to be here .
and then again , again , like und , and the thing just does n't stop .
and then , again , i 've also got to think about the pilot , like this is called heißt , at least vorne , which is what we have , unfortunately only about 20 minutes behind us , because we may -- so we 're going to have to go back to minuten minutes , and then it 's again again .
so it 's really important for me to have the same to have broken zu .
i 'm saying , `` well , here are another other things that are going to go to pfänder fahren ?
who 's got more ?
so my best time , i was very quickly , but it was in september , and now in april , i could actually never put it much faster like . .
and in the case , it 's in the moment .
and for me , as i said , they can only be able to have that kind of nur of my ears .
and the other thing that really explains what he looks like to see the possibility of my risks .
and so for me , one of the most important things i 'm saying is : trust is rather training and not this blindenvertrauen . .
so for me , as a blind now , i 'm not as much , frankly -- blindenvertrauen .
because i had also had the experience that would have been a rechts right and left .
and then it was bad , in the 1960s , because it was a little three feet .
and i 'm the three eben runtergestürzt .
so , as i said , that was what happened , of course , `` of course . ''
and i know that because the müssen have to go out , you have to be ansagen .
and i 've come here today that i 'll tell people , left and say , das , the other left .
so it was on the right , unfortunately .
it 's not that much a lot .
but sure , in situation , with pressure , you probably do n't have any of the work or your college as well as if it 's time .
then , of course , it 's often bisschen'ne schwierige herausforderung .
but for me , as i said , is vertrauen trust , i have to know the risks .
and there must be to be honest , i 'm somebody who is not seeing , relatively large in the benefit , because i 'm making my risks in many ways .
so for the kenn , i 'm pretty much all .
from the driving , tree , off the fall and i know what i 'm talking about , but , of course -- and that 's the important one -- i 'm also ' the good pages .
and then , that can be changed if trust is just there .
and if you 've found someone who really has a hundred percent of what i need .
and with that , i also allem the same goals .
because that 's what the next , really important .
you need the same goal , and i do n't really have to be clear , what does it mean to be , you know , in the same way ?
because , of course , it 's often more schneller faster than you use it .
i trust that or myself .
but the most important thing is that it 's also much accessible .
that 's what you 're going to do in terms of data .
and we also -- because we do people like this with irgend'ner sinnhaftigkeit erfüllen , we want to see sinn meaning .
and the purpose that it 's very often is that we are able to create the bottom to achieve the target .
that we make it -- in my case , for example -- from some of you , i 'm on the gegangen .
and that 's exactly what i 'm saying : i 've got to look at somebody now , or i 've got to trust it in the case that i just put that mountain up .
and how do you do that , then , on the mountain , there is a really left on the mountain .
well , i had , of course , the enormous advantage , i do n't know some things now when it comes to me a hundred meters ago .
then i was relatively . .
can be the benefit , though , fear is not a problem .
and i 've also been working on the fear of fear , now some of the bin , i 'm coming down , and i 'm going to go into it and i 'm going to put this thing called bungeesprung , or is in berlin geflogen , because you 'll be so'nem von von .
it 's a little bit more , when you go up there and you 'll end up the cars , then you do n't even have a lot to know in order to know where i 'm doing .
and these things are always interesting for me .
yeah , to have the zu , but to try to know , i 'm going to war in a place , and i 'm going to focus on it , and i can just focus out a new new experience .
and this is exactly what the auch'n bisschen looks like in isses , because it 's like , every day , 10 hours ago , and it 's just happened .
you go and it 's gone , and it 's only turned around , over and fewer plants .
you take the ranger mit with a ranger , gewehr frank from front of the first world war ii .
so if you look at büffel trends , the average is about the last one , the . .
the only thing that 's going on right now .
we 've only seen the instructions out of the distance or the other .
so what i 'm going to do is , i do n't trust , you know , there 's big trust in the - -- despite its strange , that he had .
because i thought i thought , well , well , as i said , `` i 'm probably going to get out of ' , i 'll probably get faster like this .
but as i said , it 's a pretty , thing , because you can not have a lot of change in it .
and the real exciting thing is going to be a little bit difficult .
so if you go to the hochkommt , it 's ist .
or if it 's next to a , , if you have kleinen little hat where it 's left and right now .
then it gets really beautiful , and when it 's still left at night , and it 's all with rumrennen , , and we even even have to say to us , now , at some point i 'd like to take it to you , so it 's actually going to be in looking at it , and it 's actually going to be in the way .
because , as a single , i stirnlampe out , and i was able to be able to do that .
and trust , we 've created that i just said , `` well , i can tell you , of course , of course , my friend , who was about , a hundred percent trust , i 'm ' , and we 've got that before .
but i do n't have to be a form form of security , so i do n't have to focus , because , you know , if you go on the mountain on the mountain , you 'll see that when you go to the mountain , you 're going to go on the far right to the right side , left on 11 .
there 's where you get off at the moment . everybody .
so for us trust for us in the case , we 're looking for a verbindung link , so we 're putting out a an of what i had in my hand , and then i had to go to hand in the baumelnden islands .
it was in the other wanderstock of wanderstock that i also made a little bit of the der of the distance .
and she 's at a moment now , with the foot stein stone , or with her gegen'n stone geklopft , who i knew i knew what 's going on me and i did n't actually have to focus on .
and the whole thing that really showed me how beautiful it is , because of course , because of course , there 's the top that you really see that the goal is going to go back in terms of time -- just like the , , with the . .
but the other thing is , i realized that the trust that i have in my mind , that is , you know , when i really came up , i really ziel the peak .
but trust , in other ways , the , , as trust as well .
so when we were at the top of the mountain , we were ganz in the group , and we were all over the other seven people , and they were very dense behind us , and it 's been relatively dense behind us , and it 's been relatively dense behind us , and it 's been very close to each other , and it 's been a little bit , and it 's been a little bit of everybody behind us , and i 've already thought , saying , why do n't we have a look at it all the time ?
at night you can not see the nicht in the bottom .
that 's not the reason .
and then , at some point , i found myself , `` well , sure , whose trust in their ability is pretty straightforward .
you go to the dark , you go to 12 o'clock , and then you have no light .
that 's completely , if you 're ist , the air is getting off , so it 's just und , and now it 's not even erstmal .
and then at some point , the moment that they have said is , the person , that was quite practical to walk behind you , because the friend of mine told me all the time we 've seen , we were constantly - -- just like women would .
all night , all night told us a little bit , and the other people in the group had just been able to know the , bestärkung , ok , well , it 's just a stunde hour that has been told them .
or , you know , i do n't really think about the erzählt .
and that 's exactly what it 's like to know that it might even be bad darüber about it -- we may have talked about it -- it 's just a stunde hour , the sun 's going on .
and these things , this is also moving from the outside of the outside , is going to be much limited and can be able to do so that you can also get the personal eben .
and so , to me , trust me , you know , it 's perfect , if you have the personal und and what you really want to do in the idea of the idea .
and of course , this is , of course , in the sports with the gold where you 're doing so -- i do n't really know why it 's going to do the microphone -- you know , i do n't know to test the value or see if it 's just a moving , is n't it ?
so what i do n't know is that it is , in some sense , it 's kind of ist .
if this was real gold , i 'm not here , then i would be on the , , i think .
or at least in , , steuerparadies . .
but as i say , the real thing that is , why you do that is more because you can imagine what i 've been doing and i 've been building my skills and forces on a point .
like , i was in love with my skills , but of course , in the team we all need , no matter whether in this study , in which it 's always done .
anyway , if old husband or young wife , we just need people to trust them .
and if we can have that goal in the head , we 've got to have that kind of evidence in a project in our lives .
and if you can , it can be safe in other areas .
thank you .
it 's a science for me , that 's the title of my talks , which came out after ihrer of her beautiful maps .
what 's driving me is that the whole bemühung effort that come back as a kind of in in general population .
basically , i could be happy .
and if i 'm in a gucke , , all of a sudden is only with literature to scientific issues called aufgearbeitet .
and even every single species has been a range of verständlichen zeitungen 's newspapers , magazinen , wo , where scientific issues , themen issues , kind of dargestellt .
each ant has at least a , , which is kind of scientific stuff .
even , it 's totally , when you look at what it looks like in terms of years and für for children with scientific issues .
now , every computer program has a very personal sign in the , , but nevertheless , it 's a konsumierende story .
science is one of the things i can like to show you that i like to read , but that 's not even a self .
cool , cool is one of the things that we do in terms of you , you know , kind of , you know , is that they 're cool .
at this point , a fünf five minutes has nothing to do with reality , but that 's cool , ? ?
that 's where i can observe .
big big idea , because i can laugh , i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great .
that 's extremely bad .
because that 's kind of a paradox that the future will now will be able to share with such technical problems and hope .
but at the same time , it 's not a matter of self .
i have a couple of little examples about how science or science has just done us .
a completely beispiel example : in london , you have a beautiful tower in london , der , the architect , and not so much that we put it in such a way .
what 's happening is that the west of the middle up in those caves , i was able to get this provisorisch , and then und somewhere somewhere in the others .
that went down to the press , and it was obviously a mess .
nice , the heat has been so , that this poor , , which has been very long , long enough , and it 's außenspiegel .
and that 's because you wonder , like an architect , who did n't actually have a little bit of what 's going on in physics , because i mean , it 's completely new that such a mirror of things .
so , what i found is really new , sort of vor before , where he calls mit a versenkt .
so i really wonder , what 's the more design or an architect or an architect ?
now , that 's a very simple example .
an indication , which is kind of a kind of current things , it 's also active .
so what we 've seen is a few years ago , and this is actually a few years ago when this is happening in the media .
there was even a train here , because there was also a danger of the plants that was a danger .
genes went on with green tumors .
genes were kind of what they were .
, , oh , there are genes inside .
there was certain , where the market has been in the market : `` hey , i have gemüse vegetables .
no idea what this is supposed to be .
so , yeah , okay , i 'm going to give you a problem .
but at the time , i was still working in the lab in the lab , and i was in a totally canvas , because i tried to put these evil genes into my bacteria , these mistdinger . .
and it was totally innocent , and came home , and my nachbarin , `` , , you ca n't look happy , what 's going on ?
i 'm like , yeah , i 'm going to try to get a little gene in my bacteria for three days .
so that was what i was trying to explain , so somehow a , , genes , i thought , `` yes , i do n't know the good lady when i talk about genes , you already know what it means .
that was what i was meant to say , so a certain sequence that i wanted to bring in these kolis bringen .
but that was what the woman has noticed .
this woman never ! me .
who knows what i , them , ? ?
genes is very bad .
that 's a good decade now , and yet it 's in mind .
genes , that 's something bad .
now , habe did n't read me long .
it 's getting a gene technology . it 's really gehalten in our language .
darf may be in europe , a brahmin .
it 's unterscheidet different by other corn , which has no genes at all .
another dome , lässt rats used to die .
yeah , it was a beautiful inversion .
but they are n't that old , and it 's pretty safe to me , and that 's what makes me possible .
anyway , whether it 's time or the image , everyone is talking about . .
fortunately , it 's not im in the angekommen , but i 'm afraid that it 's not a long time .
but it just shows what uncertainty in the population is because it just does n't travel with you .
secondly , we need to solve our future with these technologies .
now it was just , , nobody had this big on the topic , but it 's going to do about things that are n't really understood .
and that 's pretty sad .
how does it actually happen to the people in the lab ?
if we imagine , this little , boy , wissenschaftler scientists sit in his lab , has an experiment , irgendwas something , beautiful and good , and it 's automatically thinking , anyone who 's in the public .
then the first thing to do is go to the professor .
the head , cooles , thema , , seinen his name as a , , which is always important in science , sein .
good idea , i still am not in the public ; it 's a . .
yes , the denkt thought , oh , great idea , big , we make a draus . .
, , we have a mit einem with a project , a beautiful idea , and then it comes out from the ground .
that 's called , , yeah , but is it really ?
now these architects are barely alone , usually have a common , , a common . .
and from all those of these , it will be the , , the right cool projects , then they 'll give over the an , in the movie , to the , , whether it 's , , helmholtz , oder , max-planck-gesellschaft .
that 's the way .
and by the way , it 's going to continue to be a , , elfenbeinturm , and really cool projects , which is really projekte projects in these tracks .
so , these are hochwertige magazine , which are really good , there are all free , yeah , but who is that i am doing this ?
basically , it 's just that they 're interested in .
in the nennen we 're always going to use the der of the . .
so the ones that do n't care about it , the dann , then the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
so , in a beautiful magazine , the audience , who are interested in this , and maybe have an idea where geht is happening in this papers .
who 's really really ' me ?
the , that it does n't work .
it was n't . it was n't that the normalbürger , , i 'm going to call it to mr. müller-schulze , who read the umständen , who i was trying to do it , and i 've been trying to hold it up , the one i did n't really .
yet , again , our future is going to be kind of können if we 're involved in these labs .
, , erneuerbare , local energy , das , these are all sorts of things that are sind , the french aber is not really understanding , and it 's kind of soll .
my project , my idea , is to have different , , these small , young scientists coming out of the ground , actually completely completely from his normal zu , and to give him a class , a rule of how to communicate science .
so what happens is , a scientist scientist , so i have a writer , we all know about the last few years , and it 's , , it 's a regel rule for us not to ask his job .
as soon as he went to the mouth and say about his job , he has . us .
you know , these are scientists who tell us what a dehydrogenmonoxid .
, , listen about , chemisch , ist is almost as much as genes .
ridiculous , it 's kind of like you do n't know what 's behind it .
it 's really teaching , that 's beautiful , it 's beautiful , and it 's good when you 're on a conference , and you have people who want to tell you your , , you can tell something you want , you 'd like to tell you about erzählen , but they can not tell the water .
where is the problem , it 's really und and cheaper ?
so i was able to school , this is my idea , these young scientists , who do n't have that far in the hierarchy that are already a little bit of the school , i think , how to get out of it .
this has an ability for all of you to use , or whatever you can see , investors that also want to know what 's happening in the brain industry .
and at the end of it , it 's also that we 're being used to that , so they also have to communicate the kommunizieren .
but this training , which is just a story .
so , i 'd like to put you to a setzen , and i want to put her project to your project , erbarmungslos , ehrlich , honest , even worse .
there is a quote , i do n't know if it 's real , it 's like i ca n't explain it , then you do n't really understand it .
so , the scientists are taking out of the lab and are really trying to figure out how to communicate the really ordinary causes ?
so the stories is already a lot .
sind are completely modern , everywhere , in every university , and these are common , but also i 'm going to get it back again .
who 's going to go to the ende of the city in the university of some of you who are going to do a talk to come up a talk at a talk ?
these are the ones that do n't care about it .
that 's where i came back to my . .
so these are people who are interested in , who are going to drive there , and they 're going to hear any talks .
this is beautiful , because of any gemacht , all of them are excited , they 're happy , and that 's it .
and so i sit on a second aspect to say that there is n't this des of the project .
and these scientists are also , , how do they get kids ?
because a lot of really have been trained to reduce the matter .
because scientists , like work , and how children explore their world is equal .
children are working extremely scientific .
they do something like this .
you try to figure out what , does this work ?
, , hin , no way it does n't work , first of all , i change a few pies , make it new .
children learn extremely scientific .
these are really , , and and , , and i 'm , , which is what 's going to happen , what i really need to change is that it does n't work or not .
that 's normal !
but they have a lot of scenarios .
and of course , i think that 's only what i can do , if after all the time , and the scientists in the neighborhood , in the neighborhood , in the neighborhood , in the neighborhood , in the environment , in the environment , in the environment , in the environment , in the environment , with the children in the united states , the children , the children , the children , the children , the children , the children , the children , the children , and the way that i 'm convinced , is that the children and the scientists actually do the same language .
and then you may , maybe at some point , that 's kind of my hope , tell the kids that i also get at home , and then i 'm going to get to mr. , , who is also interested in scientific issues because the kids will tell him .
this is not somewhere in the newspaper , which is not somewhere in , , but his children tell him something that 's spiegel mit with a gearbeitet , that it 's a bread , that it 's made up there , and it 's also , and then you might be able to , as a architect can build a house .
and not just one of me , and of course , mr. , , but also the . .
that 's my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's still that the first , that i call , they have said , `` yes , no , so für for our scientists that this is just not the issue they have .
a scientist must not communicate .
yes , i think , okay , i call the next one .
but who somehow works in an industrial center , ist is in a company , as well as well as well .
thank you .
i 'm crazy .
you ca n't fly every day .
the last few weeks were bad .
the weather has done a great asteroid through the bill .
seven , soon eight years ago , i have been asked if i 'd like to take that .
i was at , , almost 10 years ago , at the regionalflugzeuge in in spain and . .
we get there right now .
they had als as a client .
and for me , it was more , i know , that 's . .
so what is this really ?
it 's actually ridiculous .
but i know who 's going to know who 's behind this , and that 's why i 'm here today .
and yet , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it 's also extremely smooth .
it 's beautiful and it 's always exciting and making big fun .
and i 'm just going to give you through the next few minutes , minuten minutes a little bit from one of these life .
i 'm a historian in the . .
the company has been for a hundred and a half years .
i 'm a historian of . .
this company has been around for 20 years .

the company has been around for about oder or jahren years .
the double the dome here at the top here .
somi .
the one image i want to show you here is the little point right , so it 's kind of red , like a drauf , or something that does n't , it 's too big .
there are only luftschiffe . .
and it 's actually just 10 active ways .
this is what happens .
there are about 20 and a half active verkehrsflugzeuge worldwide .
so this is actually not a market .
that 's not even a myth .
this is a , , a . .
and the question is : why do you do that ?
how does this happen ?
in fact , im in the corner and only 10 , because we can now start to talk about why this is so .
very short to history .
there 's a lot of crazy graf die who started here .
very short .
there 's been the first middle director in the first world war ii .
then in the first world war , zeppelin animation died by the und and , , achtundachtzig gebaut gebaut .
they went up and so on and so forth .
and when we got to london and eight to london , and with a large dort zu , there was a kampagne campaign in the fly , and there was a kampagne of the english papers full of the wheel : this is where you come , but not with a team , but in your own .
so the story is in . .
and we had an absolutely campaign .
but , , the client , was n't as well , because he 's got clear , which is what old memories did in the middle .
and what that was , for example , was a little bit positive .
but yet , in london , it was a really good campaign except the weather in north , many years ago , very bad , very . .
and we 're not . .
then zwanzig , , einundzwanzig hugo eckener , has taken that .
and it 's got a bewerkstelligt ball that 's been used to america .
this is a myth that made up the whole german nation , and it 's kind of felt when it was und and das .
and then it was done in new york mit .
and the whole german nation is in hat , and we are again .
it 's so in all the so , and it 's a little bit like this .
but it turns out to be und , and it 's only five to five , six , seven überhaupt at all , and it 's only two really big , graf und , and the unexpected , the befördert .
, . a hundred and a half , where neunundsiebzigtausend und and waren were the end of luftschiffe . .
but it was a myth .
and the dann then , at the first time , was the first , you know , the first one , which is the first , you know , it 's called a . accident .
now , next of the titanic of this event , which is one of an icon , a product , a product , and then no one has ever been looking at it .
the other tools were designed .
and , , the last one , . zerstört . .
they use the materials for , , die , hallen .
it was n't about jahre years .
and then the kind of zf friedrichshafen and , that the idea had , maybe you should start .
and i was zweitausendundfünf , , because that 's what 's worth a great product of product , we 're going to get it right now , but the
is he any market ?
so what actually is there ?
so .
now let 's talk about that .
it 's a little bit short to explain , it 's a little bit short to explain , and what we 're saying is , in fact , people have a lot of it .
there are a lot of companies involved out of this .
it 's today today , and it 's about 20 billion megawatts .
that 's a real economy , a . .
there 's a lot of it .
and so they 've also convinced me here .
it 's a very successful plane of any other plane , but it 's cool , it 's got a gas gas , and it 's not a gas and a mit with . .
it 's like a sports who 's going on in the water and then , and it 's going to do that .
now the time is n't there to explain that in detail .
it looks a mystery like a structure with a structure .
there are two types of . .
there are luftschiffe sites , which are us , in in the case and . .
they do n't have the structure in any structure , and they are sort of in in . .
these are most of the , that have been built in the world , about four , five times .
and it 's only today , as i said earlier , only more im on our own , so around .
this is what the production looks like when a tiger grew up .
left the structure .
and the skin is hochtechnologie .
come from . .
phoenix : the der of the movie machine .
damals at night were the origins .
costs one of these two million dollars is that a skin .
and it 's got to be sein , you have to be sein and have to be sein , because you 've got to see that if you have a light in it or a hole , it 's not going to hurt .
there are going to be able to do things that go and look at it in holes .
and at the end of it , a ohne without the size of it is .
so the average is an endangered product .
and this is what you see here on the bottom , quite short .
one is a key nine percent , one is a point nine percent , one is six and a half percent , , which means is about a thousand thousand im in the year .
this is very small and very good .
that 's a . .
you can see that .
but there is another trend going on us and that 's what i have here .
we had prozent percent , when i first started fünf five years ago eight years ago , prozent percent und and last year , jahr percent und .
and this year in may we were in prozent percent .
if you want to , eight years , my eight years , i want to have my eight years , and i want to leave it , you can tell at least in those eight years , of course , a der of the , , and also , in these eight years , the weather changed changed for us .
we 're . .
we can not fly auch from comfort .
you want to see something .
and the oder , or steigen , has grown up every year .
so a little thought of that our weather is not just because it 's easy , because we have weather every day .
but because this is the good thing that 's going to do is to get a program program almost 10 million dollars , and we 're a very safe part of that program .
i 'm going to come here tonight .
the framework is ready here are a flying laboratory .
heißt is the campaign .
and we do in in the zwischen and meter feet .
that means grenzschicht . .
and the seventh t goes from italy to indonesia in a gesamtprogramm . .
there are a lot of hundred hundred people that are der and der the air to how they respond to our things that we do on the ground .
and that 's where i just explain , this is where we are at the second paradox .
it 's a great operation .
and if you want to do this kind of thing , from the theme of weather .
so this is very good .
and here 's a couple of . .
the wire on sweden last week or woche week .
and in denmark , the weather is amazing , fünfundzwanzig , grad degrees , 30 degrees .
the sagen say something like they 've never had .
i 've just seen wonderful , nice hot days .
consumers were n't so bad .
we were also in africa .
and for de als , as a result of fact , i think it 's a little bit like a diamanten , which is , in durch , which is sind by durch million years .
you can also ask yourself , is that it 's all africa , that 's when you ask meaning , after a idea , to make sure that makes sense is something that 's useful if at the beginning of the movie , the film oder , or diamonds gelaufen .
so i was wondering , what do we do ?
and what do we support in that ?
at the end , we were ready to two years .
the ging went out .
the whole kam came up at und , and the project was finished .
and one drone has the fountain on the orchestra , and then it turned out that he could stay down the same .
but it was n't so bad .
we were very versicherungen , and we were very happy .
that was the prototype .
and i did n't know what to do with it .
yes , what we 're doing today is a very short little aus from . .
what we 're doing today , it 's just about complexity , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , growth or war .
what we 're doing today is the hier here in . .
we do natürlich .
we 've got to get the gluten over .
heißt alterung . .
there are always ways to be able to do that , after 10 , there will be replaced .
we basically replace the whole thing for almost five million dollars .
and then we talk about the clients we talk about .
we 've got to do it all the time .
we are an expert betrieb , , who is going to protect the german und and from the european kontrolliert , always and lower , as auch as auch , as well as auch .
it 's also und and it costs money , and it 's still going to be available .
the question is : do you actually get further ?
do you want to develop it ?
do you make more ? ?
there are , , luftschiffe . .
what do you do in that ?
do you go on the market ?
do you go in practice ?
and we also try in my time .
and we 've also had some erlitten .
like , by the way , by the way , the most zeppelin einige of some erlitten has been sold and pleite pleite .
at the beginning of the stand , the von went out .
and the population , the german population , has been saved by six million als , when the fourth verunglückt waren were , and he basically realized , the population has a gemacht .
and it 's at the time of luftschifffahrt zeppelin und and the other companies that we have in charge , or i 'm not here today , and other companies would n't come there .
we were in tokyo , . .
we were , and you hear past , in san francisco with a client .
there was a very investor . .
both projects are failed .
so . .
at the same time , we won gewonnen .
i do n't have a picture because we ca n't show the emblem noch yet .
but in america , the des of the first in will be done .
we have sold three pieces .
with entwickeln , we developed technology .
and that 's a great amount of success , but at the same time , it turns out .
two customers are basically worden because it was n't .
why did n't it ?
we know it actually .
either that the place was not the right or mussten had to be too far oder , or in america , you know , the last 30 years to have done the last 30 years .
the leute people have , , they have seen the protein , and they said , `` well , again , again , a , , the power of advertising .
there is no idea that you ca n't get there .
and it was really , in fact , almost difficult in marketing to do the next thing : hey , people an by it .
läuft go good .
the pilot built in the year , called , , passagiere . .
but last year we 've only done geschafft .
now , a half million .
that 's bad .
the dome flies routen hier here .
it 's a sense of , of course , that 's beautiful when i look at the wind as i see it , and , and all the laughter , and we do n't do any advertising , because it 's going to shake up and over again , we do n't have to do something advertising , because it 's so beautiful , and it would be that beautiful , and it would be so beautiful and it made your friends , as well , and who still continue to continue to the family .
and we 're great .
now , i 'm going to throw out again with the mistake that you 're thinking about it .
you could still go ahead .
we have a am of the und and we 're . .
it 's actually not true .
we also do advertising .
and that 's a project that was hat .
and dengue has done this with the island of zusammen .
but it 's a difficult market .
and one of the things that you also have to say is that you have to ask yourself , power advertising ?
we actually have enough advertising , but internet has a lot of change to get the über over the road , because the alles will control everything .
the ist is largely , , which is why there 's only 10 active in in the world .
we have three here .
two mammals , one , , the , , three has bought gekauft , 10 is active .
so six of 10 .
that means that we will actually be the market , if it 's one , it 's a control .
and hope , so again , they can make a future .
and what happened is , at the end of david ii , the founder of the apollo child , after his paris president und and five , he said , `` just the walk in front of what 's going on .
so ist is beautiful .
advertising we can find beautiful .
we do n't find customers .
so what we find is great , has a technological value .
we have clients .
that 's not insignificant .
it 's , , it goes on and down .
such a braucht needs for years to be able to get you
and then we have no .
there are also curious effects that are easy to control and to control .
but in any case , that is the situation , ein , a point in the global market , so it 's not a market .
yet we go on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the haben have the power to make it .
they just ask the question : in what shape do we go on ?
how much money do we spend in democracy ?
what do we do for this ?
so what 's going to do in which form ?
and i personally , you 've also asked me to say something personal , i am of course , to my dornier dornier , where i wanted to rette rette at the time against large , , and also hat have the little tot dead that 's there to save .
i was also at designing three years ago , when i was in queens island , and i saw this whole urwald hospital , and i 've got this to do that .
and back then , there was a über greenpeace greenpeace who are attracted in the money and not knowing what was going to do with it almost that we were doing it almost .
and so they agreed to . the full .
and i was thinking about three years as a und , and now i 'm doing this here in hope , a long future in the classroom .
zero , right ? sekunden seconds , i 'm done . thank you .

yeah , thank you .
that 's my three points i want to do in the minuten minutes .
why are we today in the business , or in general ?
so how do we get to emulate ?
and most importantly , what do you do ?
so what is this ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a little . .
but it 's also beginning to show the challenges .
a few years ago , it was more difficult to explain that .
that we have a problem today , now know every child .
that we have trouble .
but it is n't worth again , and these are the challenges of the growth growth .
all kinds of species are exponentially .
if you look at it in a funny long perspective , if you will , it will be a very short description in history .
in the moment , we can not imagine that it 's kind of different , in terms of being able to go up .
you know the climate change , the last jahre years .
some people say , well , they used to see the last few years .
you can see that as well , ' .
you can also say who needs to be more open ?
you can say the ocean is far away .
but it 's already , if you 're interested in a slightly bit more time to be able to deal with something real challenges , around things that really truly avoid it , otherwise we just have trouble in the , , the health .
it 's über , it 's über .
and there 's the degrees of our cities right now in our cities .
but it 's also about the , , especially in asia .
think of the stick where the large entspringen and the davon of those are going to come down and get water out of the himalayas .
it 's not really about the planet .
the planet is the most part of what we do , because there was a much bigger crisis .
and it 's , , but it 's about all around the people who are living in a context of scale very strange life .
it 's all about biodiversity .
the gray is spread out .
it 's getting less .
this is the sea center where it 's an absolutely part of our invention .
and that 's where it 's coming from ?
all of these things , say , i 'm going to sit up in one or another , or another shape .
with what we 're going to do from earth from the planet we harvest .
not only that the oil and the und and the atmosphere , but also the health materials are stolen , but they look at that .
and we just want to see that we can use such as little as possible to produce and produce the last thing .
so it 's about this -- it 's already been told the whole lot of life being really dramatic .
it 's the challenge . it 's not just climate , it 's not just c , it 's a way of living at a car .
different to economics .
our technology has completely change .
so again , if we looked at the lines , and there 's still societies in the earth that are going to be here in the way that we live with a higher resource of a single person .
in a waren , the human history of human history was three to five tons .
today it 's six to . .
so hat have this . .
and he 's very , very verteilt levels on earth .
now , in north america , more than we are more than the earth .
and in other parts of the world , they look very , very , much less .
and that 's where we consume the implications of us , the rivers , the air has gotten a lot better over the last decade but it 's essentially in the other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world , which is still less .
and that 's why the conflicts that we see , that we see , from , , is , afghanistan , where they 're looking at , they 're going to look at the forms of american research , and then they see where the neurons come from .
and this is where it 's in there , it 's , , which is , there are many neurons where the world is in the world .
so if we want to wind with this , we need to go back to the subject .
so we have to change the environmental boundaries of the planet , and the ist is everywhere .
and this , what we have here is life is not . .
this has already called the dalai union when he said , the world has enough for anyone but not for anyone .
and here we are , like , in average , we have a lot of it in average .
so .
that was kind of teil .
but i always find that you need to understand it in order to understand it worth what to change .
even though i would say , it 's worth like to live different , which is more . .
but it 's always like that . it 's kind of like , you 've got to go out of the 'rauszukommen , you have to say , `` i 'm going to tell you .
so what is it ?
and we 've got to realize that in our rich parts of the world , we 've got so much more likely to have more effective , more efficient quality of life , in private times , we do n't really know at all .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you know , people who do n't really know so well with this story .
i wrote .
und and climate change the same cause .
we work too much .
this is where we 're going to go in love , and eventually it 's too much .
i also love very hard .
and on the other hand , we 're seeing this . .
so what is a good life ?
how can we define this ?
now it 's a little scientific . .
and that 's what i said before . and what i 'm going to say is that i 'm going to tell you is that i 'm going to say , is that it 's kind of , , but what is it that is going on , how can i define this thing first ?
and there 's important , and it has always been two things .
life has the issue of the objective conditions like me is what i have to eat .
did i have a roof on the head ?
did i have friends ?
did i communicate , can i picture life ?
but also , how do i take me , how do i mean about it ?
i do n't know what the ultimate quality of life is sometimes .
and then i ' , i can make two concepts that are important .
one is needs .
the need to this needs are the fundamental dimension of our human development , of course , to be the emotion .
if we can capture our needs , we 're happy .
and no , you ca n't say , you ca n't say , you need to be sustainable .
there 's no need to win .
what is that ?
if you think about different scientists , i 've just called two .
and because of that , you see , of course the physical needs , but also need for security , for social relationships .
for protection , for patience , for , , for creativity , for , , for freedom .
all of this has been a little bit of doing money .
but in a large part , it does n't really matter , but the question is how can i put it in my life .
and there i am the second important response .
the models .
the strategy i use to give me this is to give me this needs .
and so here 's what 's going to happen , and this is what i can do with a high oder or a ressourcenverbrauch .
because i can need a lot of money or a little bit of money .
and models are just the most behavior i need to give myself my needs .
that has to do with my values , with the resources that i have .
if i have a little bit of money , i will be able to try and share my needs as if i have a lot of money on it .
it 's a story about , , which is the roof on its head , eating food , and then it 's kind of die .
and here it is , it can be a little bit or a little bit of , , which can be very sustainable or sein .
and if we 're all the tools that are available to me for my needs , then we 're talking about a life .
so .
this was the kind of scientific . machine .
and now , what can we do now ?
how is this going ?
and there 's just some evidence .
of course , it also has to find everybody else .
but the evidence of the individual way in a technological way , which is , i think , a lot of technology in terms of technology and also at a political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
so the photos in the beginning , they 've said , the danger is that we 're used to , at more , more energy , more resources .
so for the last time , the quality of life has increased because the effects are always worse , like , and they 're going to get rid of them .
or , if we can do it in a different way in a different way that can be less , , maybe with less prices , but with higher quality of life .
there 's one of my favorite clips , maybe some of you have a few , von of the der of this subject , so it 's more quality of life .
that 's a lot of about technology like this , i can use every single thing that we use , that we use the computer , the coffee , the coffee , the surface , how can i make this happen ?
`` well , i can produce a different way today , i can build the house of wood , etc .
in order to make much less more and more of the same quality of life .
my other teacher , bleek hat has been put this as well , the pro per , , and there we are at the time today , which is now a very deep way of looking at it .
so where 's the need ?
so what do i actually want to do ?
and how can i do that with a little bit of tun ?
it does n't stop with a little less , with , , neunzig , prozent percent .
there 's a lot of examples that can do this .
in miami , a tower is built with 20 . .
it 's been built by seven ist .
it 's essentially complicated .
you know , if you could n't take it in jahren years and then do n't need it anymore , and then back in your pieces and do n't like it , so much less resources with everything else you 're going to get here in the moment of half , and the goal is with a fifth of the house , over the house , with this fifth of the house .
but it 's a lot in our own , kind of , how do i actually actually ?
there was a beautiful book called hat , . .
where he shows , how hard it is , sort of , like , it 's kind of like coming out of this cartoon .
the , , i want to take the others away , and then i 'm kind of in in this way .
you know , you yourself , kind of , a great thing that i 'm quickly , , and then i get the new one .
on the most beautiful hand , i 'm the , , which you know .
when i started my medical center , some years ago , we wrote a letter .
and then you can wait at the letter of the letter now , `` i 'm going to argue email , is wahnsinnige zeitersparnis .
that 's what i write hundreds of email .
and i can do a lot more .
that 's chocolate , that 's economic , we 're going to go back to it .
but i do n't really have time .
i did n't know for it .
but there are good examples , slow food , for example , where i really der the der of the quality and the des of the in .
and with a small mehr of genetic life .
one of my favorites is . .
now , you know , you 've got heutzutage now that the average person is in germany with us in germany , in about 10 things in the car .
you can start on that .
who had two , three generations of 10,000 stuff , had employees , personal .
they 've got that .
we need to organize ourselves .
and increasingly people come to be clear with all of these things .
and i need a framework that helps us help us . us with these examples .
now , what i 'm interesting now is , maybe even more serious use of light is going to go , which is , i do n't have any more 10,000 things .
the next example is an use instead .
a real ballet .
star , cebit , hat hat may be developed , perhaps 20 years ago .
in the process , it uses more people if they think about denken .
if you think about denken .
studies , business models that are simply working on it , how do you get things that we already built this beautiful hier , which has been built in front of a few hundred years ago , and it 's still been used over the other decade , and it 's about going on .
that 's what else was doing just better .
that 's also a question of justice .
and i 've been showing you how das that is , you know , this is an image between africa and europe and a real world .
so , that all at the same time , you can see these resources , if we 're going to consume less .
and that 's not not less quality because a lot of us seem to see too much .
but it 's a fundamental task to the economy , the company , these products , these products , that we need to make a good life with much less resources .
last part of this , this has something to do with the real policy of politics for the growth of growth .
if you read a little bit of attention , then you have a little bit of , , jetzt , now the jede per week is going to go back and down the wieder every week .
it says , yes , a crisis is about the door after my view , and also after what we 've been talking about a lot of economists , and that 's where they 've done , and here 's the numbers for , , they can just find the relevant for all countries growth .
and there is no reason to it again , so as i know it from my youth from the past years .
in part , it 's a mathematical issue .
one is a point five percent growth today today as eight percent growth .
and eight percent is what china has today .
there 's also a couple of us there , and maybe jahren years ago .
in fact , if it 's bigger , of course , it 's still eight percent . .
the one percent is still a lot , so we 'll live well .
but you have to sort of , it , which means not even if we had zero percent growth in the next year as well as well as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as it has to consume and consume income in this year .
we can do that well and we can work with it .
it 's also not that way , because you know these statistics that are going to show the growth for growth long .
the economy grows , but the quality of life remains in exponential countries , on which we are .
and by the way , they also do work with no growth , and that 's not so deeply together , like that 's going to get away from und and how they 're all your own .
it 's just simple , and then you have to return to economics .
and it 's coming over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again , '' that 's what i 'm going to do , in the trend , in the trend , a greater history of this topic , is going to
already , phelps , , who was running on his damit in his damit that he said , the good life of the good economy , the good should the of the good life .
that 's what they 're looking at . not to do not necessarily to create returns , not necessarily in terms of the growth of our countries .
for instance , for those countries , also for china , for india , it 's very different story .
and it 's only that , again , as we grow it up , we 're just going to grow up in this level , on this lower level where we 're going to continue to live and economies .
it takes politics .
it needs goals .
it needs , . it needs economists .
it does n't just need growth , but we should really be looking at it and measure and ask , how does it actually work with the quality of life , then it 's in ?
is the connection ?
and then our politicians will measure .
of course , what 's the syllabus ?
how do you go together ?
we need a totally aspect of what is to be the endlich end , and not the work .
and those of you who are particularly members of you today , but also the nurses , you know the very good .
what 's going on on terms of control , we can actually paid a computer program .
that could make a difference .
the resources are kind of evolved , and therefore the resources are in charge and not the work .
and one of the things that you 've got to look at all of you 've got is to create all of the umstellen available to create jobs in order to protect them , health , health , population without growth .
that 's because it 's a little bit hard .
that means there 's more or less or less , in all levels can be working into that direction , can we be hard to ask us as a company , as a consumers , as consumers as consumers , what do we actually need , how do we make it good for us ?
what do we need , and what do we do n't need
so the real policy of politics that we 've done is sharks .
some evidence i gave .
and last , of course , the science prozent percent of all energy is still getting into the direction of how we can control the growth growth ?
but unfortunately , nobody did n't .
if you look at the same time , if you look at the development over the last 20 years , it 's always going down because it 's not .
politics is not worth , and it 's not going to do that it 's not going to produce growth , but that 's the question we do with it , and it 's so that we have a good life of it .
so 's 's action .
you may be able to map the you want to the lake .
with heart , brains , hand and past , we will need to get that one .
thank you .
i 'm salzburger . .
and i love this city .
this city has so much of stories .
one of them has studied a few hundred years ago .
it has to do with creative performance .
and i 'm going to give you a little bit of scale in this creative scale .
it 's going to be done with the hohensalzburg .
this is burg , , who is here in the middle of this city , and a lot of this city is also the same as well .
another story before .
it was in a hot in in , , texas .
a man is looking at how it looks like in your shoes .
that 's too warm .
he 's pregnant , he does n't know that .
he 's going to turn out a aus aus aus , and it was n't very long , and it 's a lot of power there .
he den the day in a messer , and he gets a new climate in the classroom .
it 's the , , geboren , born .
and this number that you see here is the place in the der of the polegato heute today .
a company is , , with four letters .
one or another one of them knows it .
he even paid the original idea .
they have a lot .
so he says , well , ich , i make my own companies .
it 's geht .
currently today , several thousand employees today are in least many thousands of employees in terms of ländern countries .
this is how much to be creative now .
why not put something new , which is n't there ?
and number enough , perhaps the question is to have the question .
if they do n't know , it 's a chance to be a chance .
and this is a question that often has helped me , in difficult situations .
if something is a little bit wrong , my staff would n't be in technology or technology .
, , little memory , . .
what is this opportunity ?
and it 's coming from ins into the . .
what 's going to do is , what this is about to me , with this example here .
and another example was studied by the mobiliar platform , and it 's the aussagen of . .
and the purpose of how creative people can be when it goes to their own investment .
i want to show you some examples here .
so these are actually , in fact , with the mobiliar gesture and which has also made it open .
i 'm ' .
my son was n't . the woman .
he 's just , , and this is the durch . . .
or i had the whole day , as i reached the press , i grew up a depression in my shape and i could n't see the other car .
clearly who it is , right ?
the bush .
the sind are . .
i 've been gewesen and two times a little bit .
and i can tell you , at least , the half auszahlen .
the last thing i did n't listen to the crash .
and the young woman was in . .
if you 're a man 's a man , every more explanation .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so humans are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish to myself , and i dream that we all need more of
many of us are in a schonhaltung . .
and that does n't need to be like that .
why not do n't make things different differently ?
old things that we do are we 're doing that in the workforce that might us have oder or , as the opposite .
now , why do n't they just do anything differently , the , , the small simple .
and there 's so unternehmen companies that use this .
for example , for example , they 've got these von ihren of their fingers , these signs or on the wall , and there may be something like this .
also another way , right ?
so , the coffee goes instead of a . .
or something like that .
we do n't have a , , euch .
is n't , today , right ?
if you ca n't make a cell phone .
or eat for me , we wir both .
sandrine , but creative .
that 's what it takes .
i 'm going to give you one of the customers , or i 'm going to give you back and say , okay , that 's what i like .
the `` i '' .
a seminarhotel hat has in the current aufgeschlagen , and it 's in . .
once the bird once , again , the current news , once politics .
if you 've got three on that category , you were . .
once , they got the popular beim over to the food .
it 's a gebäude building , and it 's very small , so it had all its hands to do .
it was too busy .
they 're thinking , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we ca n't get faster faster in the kitchen .
the problem is arrived .
in each table , a website will be strauß olivenöl , , und and mörser .
so , that turns out to be the waiting in the waiting in the waiting .
just different .
a creative idea , and maybe with the gelöst region .
there 's a person who is n't exactly the power .
this person is the leader of the , so the der of the . .
and what they 're doing is german . .
already the second day , which is still going on , is four days .
a company has taken up in weselsky zum for the month of the month , and you may have heard that .
it 's a sagt statement , it 's like , we thank you .
people are coming to us .
in the '60s , it will be betrieben , people have access to play because of course , for all of us , to come from one to b .
but why not now can use something at all , rather than something that do something ?
sometimes , creativity happens .
and it comes out of a vielleicht , maybe in the company that you might know .
so what we 've known is that it 's not really good to do that . it 's not really good to you , but it 's going to have to save the auch , but it 's a little bit .
you can see the car in the car .
because we know , we know , the different , und , and all kinds of ways .
yeah .
why not a piece of ins into the car when you 're steht ?
or , you know , there 's also ways to create the creative creative .
and all this has simply done with humor , with joy , with sometimes it 's stupid , ? ?
sometimes it 's funny .
one time , my sohn son was in the office office .
and it 's sitting on this stage before .
so , we 've got a number of rund about this .
and then from the left of the right , he 's got joy , and i put in my elternmanier sag saying to you , listen , that 's not a picture here .
he was looking at me , looking at big eyes , but . .
and in the moment that moment , i was in the right , right ?
why is this not a playground ?
why is this what we do , not the playground for adults ?
so that 's what much does , right ?
if we 're curious , if we use our talents , what we like to do .
and so that 's what they do .
the argument is that if you take a particular day of the week , it changes what in your brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's kind of focus on another day .
this is a different day we do n't have any day .
it 's in the way .
it 's also telling you in the media .
on the heißt means , only a day is a day .
or if the most beautiful time of the year before , the prime minister .
so what 's the rest of the wochen weeks of the year ?
is it so terrible ?
do we all have so terrible jobs ?
a hatte had been given it on a gegeben , this issue .
yes , i 'm going to tell you the rest of the rest .
or in , , on facebook , everywhere in the social networks is going to hit this issue .
once die , one of the in in . .
there are a lot of people and i 'd like to look at it .
what do you know in the , , what is there ?
and one day , i 'm going to try and buy the business with these people .
and the first sign that you see here , yes , it 's quite nice .
so , for example , that 's what we do .
i do n't like that one , too father from five children , but i also love my work .
yeah .
or quiet for for ist is the schild sign .
and why this is what makes your mind that goes up and still more and more and more .
somebody has once an answer to this direction , not the buddha , and they are their jobs .
and i actually do n't actually need to go here with pink , here and say , okay , let 's change .
what 's beautiful about my job ?
it 's stupid , even though it 's the pink ist , it looks like this .
so , to speak something beautiful , which is not beautiful , does n't really work .
the pink rouge , by the way , is to drive great to the interview .
that 's where she 's going to fly into a wonderful , the fly .
but to taugt , they do n't .
where do n't we change that ?
actually the job , the content , our ? ?
within the company , outside as . .
it may end up in a system where we feel like the mouse .
the mouse is going to go inside of this blog , and it 's going to go and click , and eventually it 's going to quickly , this wheel , it just die the arms and you shake it out .
what makes the mouse ?
they do n't know anything else , it goes back in the . .
and again , again , the movie is das , which is , you might never tell the kennen .
that 's nice hier here , so you can do it , and it goes over and over again .
and that , what we think as a funny is probably the mouse moment , yes ?
or something needs that umdenkt . .
i was so many years ago when i was at the bottom of a nach .
and at the time it turned out to the street , i felt it was completely black before my eyes and i kind of had to stand .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , what is there ?
he looked at me and said , no , it 's all fine .
but how does it look like this ?
and i looked at my wife to see that , and saw , i worked through three weeks , and somehow i kind of mich myself .
after 20 years , the und and the people who are in the early early asking whether we can do the end at night .
i also thought , what is it actually for jobs ?
and i started to get , , again , to put other priorities , to see that i had time with my family , something good for me .
' , if there 's no doubt of other gibt in my job , a new paradigm .
i 've found , the drawings of large groups that make me really joy .
i 'm going to do like einstein and und and also other things , but to give those talks to some experiences that make it really joy .
and that was n't always the case .
so i 've got to realize that this stress device is sick .
and sometimes , the thing that 's going to do is to take this shot before the front , von from mine was gone out of the hospital after he 'd had a heart attack , and then it starts on , and he starts . .
as soon as i said , you walk with it , it 's always , me , yes , you 're walking with it .
now , he goes himself .
so , with , , beautiful slowly , in the right stage , but eventually we 'll also walk together .
what happens ?
in the bottom we 'll all need .
the gehen go down , but a curve that is more efficient is the lack of international health .
minus thousand percent of people around the last 10 years , fast minus , that is beautiful , that 's less .
rise of the modern diseases plus prozent percent .
this is something i think you must be like this ?
so why is that ?
is this just in venice ?
no , it 's like in germany .
it 's , , das , that 's going to require anything .
that 's like to spot the left .
at the bottom of extreme diseases , a hundred percent in the last 10 years , there 's a great german raus .
the number of psychopharmaka nimmt .
the cost .
and you think all kinds of plastic , what can we do with this topic ?
so for example , this is a way to treat hoppalas , , like here .
so it 's good .
and somebody once said no pain is n't a solution .
but what is the solution ?
so what is it that we 're going to do is power and und and joy ?
and it made me last years .
i think , is there something like , , can there be anything about this ?
i 'm , , the job is not what makes us erfüllt and happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , faith and so forth .
but the fact is that we spend the greatest part of our in in work .
and if we do that , it 's not that they do n't know what it means to us .
and i was like , `` last , '' the last thing i want to do is to give up to you for the last thing .
these little , , which you 'll feel is easier to see .
steht stands to build energy , freedom and environment .
that means , how did i give my daughters ?
what 's the environment i do with who ?
so what freedom did i think this is what i want to do ?
because it 's the degrees of , that . us .
the more of this , the more stress .
and what am i doing from it ?
the toolbox .
this is these four areas .
and it can see it for yourself .
i had to remember that for myself a few years ago , and i 'll do it again .
can i use my societies ?
in which environment ?
and that means , sometimes i 'm going to go into a white white with my laptop , to give the capital , or a . .
the freedom .
what freedom can i take me to do is to do this which is important .
and i do it ?
the toolbox .
the last round .
and then there are people who tell me why that 's not .
and why this is much more difficult to you .
then i was very happy to have an answer to that .
you want to find out .
you do n't .
and by the time you can choose , i 'm like , i 'm like , i 'm able to figure out , or i guess ?
and they 're actually going to have in both .
so what do we do with our hearts ?
each of you have his big mitbekommen .
it 's a lot too small .
it 's filled with transportation , with gold , with everything else with your skills .
so what do we do from this ?
by the end of the end we ask this .
or if you 're in the hospital , or at the end of a life .
what did i do with my talent ?
by the way , if you think about it , i think it 's going to have access to schokolade-spezialitäten , , which is like to give up here .
so what we 're doing with our talent is that my first question is that my first question , too to me , is to me .
' i am good enough .
and resources .
there was another story with a story .
i wanted to tell you about . .
and that 's where i 'm going to do in the position .
this was a crime that was saving in the als as a half years ago .
and the enemies realized that this was done as well as well is that they could n't take them .
the vertical walls kind of steile species , the zur movement , is verriegelt , , gesichert . .
was damals at the time .
so the point thought , well , if we did n't come out , then we form a . .
we do n't let go out there .
let 's see how long that is there .
they had it taken from long to the day where they were almost waren .
they only had a der that was already going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a auf , and they would give me this und and give me three days .
tr go , du . you 've got , , come up , take the und and help us .
geht go through the weg path .
on the other hand , the sound , as above the wall of ein , is going to be released again from left to the right , and it 's in early early .
well , it turns out , a , , which is it .
it 's short .
again , a herumgeführt , , up on the wall of , , this is now black .
enemies think , oh , it 's got two , , it might take me .
and at the end of the day , he 's known to the , who 's going to come up and forth .
at the end of the second day , after six different gesehen , they 've moved down in a ab .
because they thought it takes us too long ; we do n't think about it .
and then the runter came down to und and den the . .
one that they had and they had haben .
these are the stierwascher entstanden .
i like this idea that everything is there , what we need , and that we have everything .
sometimes it 's ressourcen resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little .
but also , we can do something .
we have no idea of power that we have to invent the world every day .
and if you think that might now be a good sein , you have right .
in the spring of the spring .
it 's coming .
and we 're in wissen knowledge where the snow is going to start to be able to get the plants to green brown gebilden .
there 's where i think you 're going to get out of these proteins .
and there 's a really die here that we then harvest and eat .
so there is the area of the area , and then we can und and bread .
there are any animals that eat .
there is people who then eat the products from that later .
and it gets automatically .
but if you think about it , maybe it 's not so expensive everything , it 's going to be a fear and elephants .
and of course , it 's a threat that maybe it 's very valuable , and it 's also very popular , but it 's also very popular , but at the context of the fashion , that connection from the flower to plant a very , very large role .
there are research that show that there are over to prozent percent of our food , especially food , if we would n't have bees .
it also sounds like this because it 's normal for us , and we certainly do n't like it .
there was also a very interesting film for a while , a very interesting movie , zum , right now .
and i assure you , look at it .
but we 're now excited to the teichmann der who 's actually working with bees , which is really , in fact , in die the importance of bees .
this is what he 's doing on a school at und , and he 's going to tell us a few about his work .
please , mr. . .
yeah , good evening .
there was a big thank for mr. und and the whole thing .
that i 'm going to do with my project , beziehungsweise bienen-machen-schule beitragen something else about the life of bees .
and that also gives you a einer of a etwas to tell you a little bit of little zu .
because i 'm going to suggest that the speech of them are sind , it would be a unternehmen company to want to bring them into a minuten and a half minutes in the event of the future .
i do n't .
but maybe it can make me feel that you 're going to start able to love this anfangen , or you 're going to be able to get a certain kind of empathy to be able to join you , and you 're sure to it for this wahrhaftige , insekt der of the rings .
my name is thomas , , and i 'm jahre years old , who 's a wonderful woman named , father of five children , and have different und and abgeschlossen und , and working in the mit of jugendlichen and adults .
i 'm a member in the überlingen und , and in the economy , zur zur .
and today , in the brachenreuthe , we 're in the brachenreuthe oberhalb of mit to our oldest students .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in practice .
now , ist is actually a game of kästner und and von . .
our flying classroom is a , , an silence .
and they 're also moving to zero .
it 's almost a angelegenheit issue .
and not demand , the old government have already got the relationship between honey to fra miel 's miel miel and the melos .
and in a wonderful von homer , he describes how the apollon seine musen his zu dem to inspire him that he can sell again .
but what they do n't do is they do n't even go themselves themselves , but they send their blue bees and they put it on the mouse and they put it into their mouth , and then they came up with these words like honey from the fließen .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully i can leave you this today .
yeah .
the flying classroom .
i come to the project .
so one of these things that we 've seen is my students at what they 've been building with , and they 've built for about 30 to tage days in a . .
in schulen schools , from us in ins in the school school , or in the in industry , we put in the von of oder or in the nach .
a nach for oder or in bei .
the teacher who 's carrying this project go with me in the class , and we 're looking at a platz place for a . .
mostly at the window that children can see something like this .
and before all of the things that the bees and then there are over the desk and they can können again .
and then at the window of the window , there 's a pencil .
so .
and then the whole thing started to me .
so i 'm going to take a bienenvolk and a ' , and i 'm going to put it out of a bienenvolk zwei two heraus , and now you 're going to get here right now .
important to this on these sind are also .
also , we 've got brut , , and we 've got to be thin sein on the edge , so fresh eggs .
and then a , , there is up there .
there 's honey inside .
you need , if bad weather is , and you ca n't fly .
so .
this is what it looks like .
and then the hier line over here , and immediately begins to the river of the places that are oder in school .
and now something wonderful .
ladies and gentlemen , the bees in there in the class , they suddenly have a crisis .
their people are not more .
they 're tired .
they do n't find their queen .
and that 's the most important example of what i think is the most important thing that he 's thinking about is the queen in the old people .
so that 's not on these two sitzt .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they begin to . .
yes , the sagt . they . .
you hear that .
they 're spending almost a höher higher than if they usually live in their mit with a queen .
and now we start a . .
ladies and gentlemen , in one night , you 're now developing the need to help a new people , and the whole thing has without , , ohne , without loss , without , , and meinungen .
so here 's the people , and then it turns into the first night in the first night
because without queen , the people would n't exist in six weeks .
because life is only six weeks long .
so .
and in this very first night , they 'll take a pen out of one of these einen , and put it into these hinein .
and then they want to be stopped .
anybody who had in in high school is how do you want that ?
yes , it 's technically , , but it 's all possible . .
that 's true .
and now something wonderful .
this is something that normally usually become a geworden wäre in the eine .
the retina system has the first three days of the same genetic code as the . .
it 's von by a royale . .
you know this term .
and immediately , at that point , on the stellen level of the genetic code .
the werden are changing by the in in the royale .
we 've had heard that we 've heard what we eat ; it determines what 's going on .
and at the queen , it 's really wonderful to experience .
so three days now , five days .
and they can . students out .
this is what you see in education .
and then this cell will mit with a wachs , and the whole thing does n't happen because the people now have carbon access to it or because of a sagt , so it 's going to be , or you 're going to have to say that it 's now .
no , this is happening .
ladies and gentlemen , it 's a oder or a entschluss .
and then , students , eight days every student knows know , three five eight a queen so they make the queen . .
and the day , if it 's going to happen , the teacher has put the iphone in the back of the da room at the students at five o'clock .
and then the mother says , say , what about you ?
yes , i have to put in school .
yeah , why is that ?
yes , our queen . .
yes ?
and then the morning are six in school .
and then they put their platt an on this , , because they want to wollen the queen .
and if you can really experience that , tell you something .
that 's the queen .
so .
a little bit higher .
and then they come up and left these names .
the first thing that they do is they power the queen , they 're missing their wings , and now they are now with their diesem of this people what they 're wearing a queen has their smell , their , , their . .
the people now has a identity .
now three to five days for those names .
by the vorne , you get your royale . .
on the back of the redwood , from the people , from this . .
and after five days , this queen will get great out of heraus .
some think of thinking , yeah , i 've seen a im im in . .
keep . .
which is completely different .
and we let we .
and this is the queen that are going to go through it alone without , , without , , from this heraus from up to two kilometers high .
you certainly have seen in your pockets .
in fact , in the und and will there , there 's a historical nun nun , from seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so the way in islam , as in islam , where the guy are different women have to be the queen , the seven to 12 men .
and the whole thing happens in a wonderful way in the beginning .
the drone comes from the back of the , , and this is the queen that 's jetzt right now in the historical all of all that they need to put on seeds for three years .
it 's an amazing experience .
if they finished , they finished , and they fall dead in the sky .
and then the queen comes back and starts to put eggs .
there 's always one , two students in the class that 's going to see this .
they also see the queen .
yeah .
and then finally , the project is in the school because it will be the wieder of verdeckelt and the queen , and the queen 's going to come up in there .
and then i come out of a night before , at this point .
' , the von of the outside , and at the next morning , i 'm going to tell you this mit with the queen and these bees to come up with me .
and there 's the queen here .
yeah .

and it 's mostly 10 to 12 .
and then this is , these two kommen are coming here right now .
in a full stick , in a cage and now , the people can be great and more powerful .
why bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the children who have experienced the time , forget no more .
yeah .
it 's not just that , in this case , students have put all the time with the bees , but the whole school is in this class .
and the teacher , if he knows something , if he can sound it , it can sound a time after another .
and you can see , you can see , bees and geschichtsepoche vor years ago , we 've got authors where the people have haben the honey .
a few months ago , in israel , a few months ago , in israel , in israel , in israel , the people who have been used to have the bees .
now , any human culture has been building the bees .
or the other day , the bees were over in every culture .
in china , in india , in egypt , in egypt , in egypt in egypt .
everywhere they were .
the human cultures ladies and gentlemen are left .
he can , a , , a anschließen bank , he can download a anschließen .
ladies and gentlemen do you know what flowers or trees do the bees , what they need ?
now , in summer there 's now in the summer of agriculture .
that 's out there , it 's a green desert for our bees .
yes ?
he can go with the students in the gehen , and there are 27 plants , and there are 27 plants , and then they can und , and look , how long would you take that to my flowers now ?
how long are they ? in the top ?
and as long , you need to come back to them .
he can geometrie-epoche veranstalten .
how do i get a windmill ?
yeah .
you know , if this is , in the die , the peak is going up , or at least the bottom side up here .
look at that .
it can be a mathematics of mathematics .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can even discover the sogar auf onto these entdecken .
and then he comes to the question of how could be black from london den the nobel prize ?
because he decided the bees to see it in the ground .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a favela , is . .
there 's a bee there .
and just the professor , , the many years in an at the university of the university , has found it in rausgefunden , that the bees are able to create a schaffen plant on individuals .
it 's like a netz network that 's going to create a schaffen net on the auf floor , and now with hertz ihren your dort , and the bees , the , , the mit , with their . .
do you see what these bees do in school ?
it 's par excellence excellence , and the kids are losing the fear of bees .
and they 're creating a awareness for bees .
they learn , , look at what the bees do .
and they get a sense of these things which is basically only lives for us .
the bees do n't even produce a tenth of a mile in the year .
jahren years ago , the only way i was the only way to make a difference .
they accumulate on the draußen outside the trees .
that 's a , , dem her guys .
and now imagine that in summer , that 's -- -- siebzigtausend bees on such a strong space , at grad degrees .
hey , this is ohne without the end .
no , not the bees .
because they 're in this natürliches natural field .
they 're collecting the pollen , and by the way they , it , it will be a eiweißernährung . .
someone who 's in the erkrankt board , bronchitis , , der that can go today to a gehen , and to lassen a verschreiben lassen by die the aus from the people .
and of course , a grid has come from and mit with a und and so forth .
yeah , and then ladies and gentlemen were the basis of how the bees are , of course , and we would have less vision if the bees would n't fly in , or we 'd better like the chinese to go on the rumklettern , and they would breathe themselves .
there 's a lot more things .
look at the , , there 's out there on the top of the arctic , where the cows are . .
and there 's the bee going on , you get the und out of the und .
and we get the cow and the den , and only because it 's weißklee aufnimmt , it 's . .
yes ?
and then they put it back and look , `` oh , i have weißklee , , ah , i can . it again .
and then we have milk .
that makes the bee .
yes ?
and at the end of the day , the bee gives us the most valuable what it is in nature .
the honey .
i want to come to this point short .
so my students are kind of like they 're building this together , and then you can go to the schools .
now , that 's not my favorite aber , but once i had a student in college , and i said , i said , i said , i said , i said , i said , i said , i said , i said , i said , i put it in the school store in überlingen , and i said you , you know , `` you 're ' .
and then he says , `` well , i 'm hot .
i come from bei to und , and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been in und , for five years in und , and for two years in 2009 ,
and i 'm pleased to say that now i do n't have to learn anymore and learn with your hands .
, , yes , with the head .
and a ging went through the , , gymnasium school .
and more than half of them said , oh yes , we want that .
my students are going to talk an enormous amount of evolution , and the protocell between , in portugal , normal and menschen people , through the bees .
you 're going to get it on a screen , and you get yourself , my students and a certain hand .
how do you get your mind ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how do you get to the dem of the ? ?
and that 's where i think , again , it 's a man who und the other people and give him a new gibt .
and he says , `` so , let 's start with
at the end of a small poem by von of . .
who like the bee would feel the sun through the fühlt , the way to the findet , would never lose the die the fields in the glanz condition like the moment he lived , he would barely cry .
thank you .
hello , my friends in the world .
welcome to the experience of my project .
the project of my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a end of female biases .
in my view of the world 's largest crime , because it has been schon since for many years .
the society against women and a half dollars per day .
the first thing i 'm going to do is i
my name is , , i 'm coming out of translation .
and i was . jahre years a betrieben .
you can think of this as not hat .
i did n't feel . .
and i was glad i could und in the theme of a gut and exciting sharing .
for instance , this one .
a huge über of the atlantic from africa to brazil .
on the y-axis , a transistor in the brasiliens south brazil in the freilebenden department of the last indianern circle of the , .
this was a , , where i was more war than , , more als than . .
but they were able to be able to find the interest of the media , and even a little bit of people like me could bring up the language .
hab , i was die danakil-wüste danakil-wüste danakil-wüste .
and at the time , there was an war between alaska and ethiopia and we were there in these homes .
and yet , despite all of the unexpected that we 've done , we knew that we were on the other side of the gastfreundschaft der of the , that beduinische us .
and so twice of what we 've been trained , and our two , that you see are going to see with your bodies as living vor to us , and the sagten , these are my favorite .
if you want to kill the kill , it would take you through us .
something like that , in no other culture .
and then in a young year , we learned that if you do n't reduce islam , you ca n't reduce terrorism .
now , christians do n't want to be reduced by their terrorism .
for example , the . .
the , , the . .
but it 's better to the real values as , , social responsibility .
that 's the values to fight it .
after many years , i 've been in this gewesen , with my wife . .
and that 's where we heard about this weibliche of women .
so when i heard that prozent percent of the everyday people who were in charge of their patients are christians and hab , i was thinking to myself , how can i feel as much as islam as islam as well as if islam was even more likely to put in the shoes of the shoes ?
and the idea was to get out of the highest leaders of islam to explain the need to get the option to the music .
we were working in german organizations that we have n't found .
and then we had to hear now , we 'd be completely , .
you 'd kind of would be kehle .
in terms of killer international international international , we 've created our own organization .
and it was made by und and unabhängig .
and to make that battle also , we needed images .
there was a lack of success .
and so und and i go back to this desert to make the hidden camera these images .
the bad bilder pictures i 'm going to do n't show you , but i want to do the crime .
girl at the age of four weeks to the crash , some of their parents and family , , they come out of their parents and family , , and they put them on the threads , and they were n't going to bring them up to the trains and the ab and the ab and the ab and the ab and the ab and the ab and the ab and the ab näht with a die , without mit instruments with instrumenten instruments without und and und and the soll .
what you 're sitting at is a von of the size of a . .
now , what you get is a . .
if you take your weight , you get two weeks .
sadly , in body and the soul , ihrer their dignity .
this was the beginning of verstümmelung . .
it 's going on .
the man needs to open .
he never saw a frau woman .
they said , `` oh , osorio , it 's not a problem .
you put your genome with ein , and then you du durch .
and if you do n't use it , it 's not bad .
then you put that up and you put it down .
this is verstümmelung . .
it 's going to die .
now , this had done three months ago .
in fact , the girl has lost his language .
these are the , , some in asia .
most of them are regiert .
and whenever we asked muslims , why did you do that ?
was the antwort answer that we have to do , that 's in the koran .
there 's nothing about it in the koran .
each bekennt fünfmal five months in the usa , like allah , , the creator , is perfect , . .
but they do n't seem to believe what they 're saying .
it allah , . it 's a zu to be wrong with women , and so that you could be used as a mensch person in women .
but now we had the images of the first landscape to be this . .
he uns us , his whole zusammenzutrommeln zu at a conference .
there was hard graphics , two days .
but we had the energy for our site , the highest auf on our side .
and then the great decision , of course , is against all human rights , against religion , we need to . him .
and the way , the way , the way of the way , was the way of this new unterschrieben
and if you know africa and you know that , you know , it 's only for these people .
and it got wild , and we had the difficulty in other countries .
short example . dort gestattete der the highest , , the des of the country , his message is that it is a crime to write zu and to wear the zu .
weeks , we were moved on , with their own . .
we had a hundred hatten of hatten .
and where we came , we only have open ears , open arms , and the lessons , holy erlebt .
and as we wanted to leave the country at the moment , the great salt and rüdiger , , you want to see the länder countries ?
this is a lot of life going on .
he 's right .
i 'm a und , and you 've got to go slowly to this .
and most of all , he was an idea .
he said , if you 're able to put the ten muslime out of the world to a table , and you want to explain the needs to get the needs , then it 's a non-zero-sum tube .
und and i flew into jerusalem in the und , and there 's a der of the . .
and the für for recht , the , , the eminenz professor of gum'a bekamen came up with a . .
he 'd heard the idea that was really excited , especially when we , that we would prevent that .
and that 's what we 're doing with parenting that support us .
and then he said , `` i 'm not just going to just , the conference like we 've been asked for it , but i 'm going to take the übernehmen .
and that 's what he did .
over over decades of over , we 've got our talent back in the years .
international zum for der of the female body bodies .
under the des of the professor professor , gum'a gum'a .
and everybody 's got it .
a hundred , , but the highest side of the world .
in the middle of , , the man 's in in venezuela , and in the rest of europe , it 's the most dangerous man 's disease because of cartoons .
so men can decide the lives and death .
but also the other .
on the left of al-azhar , , the right of the , , my . .
the highest of the world .
and i 'm just going to give you a little bit somewhere in front of those .
and then i did .
it started the conference .
and under our library at the von of the left of egypt .
the al-azhar der in egypt , von by mubarak und and rüdiger , , germany .
so much for granted , islam is not . .
we also had medical die on their way even a little bit of time , which is terrible to women in there , the . .
and then they had to show up their movie , . .
reality .
the men had augen eyes .
they went back to türen , just two hours , they decided , a geschrieben board , a . .
the tritt comes in front of the cameras , was what you have asked .
and the most important one , which was this one .
female ist is a verbrechen sign against the highest values of islam .
he die the . .
we thought the job was done , but we did n't have the ohne without our gemacht .
because the deal to talk about the woman 's der is stronger than anyone else .
that 's why we have . .
we have this conference in this conference called the buch book .
a für for the dieser of the world .
and because mr. , , the , , it was so good , the book , he did it with a staff .
it will take us from their hands .
so in many countries , we had to have a foundation with the höchsten .
and they read that with interest in a few people so excited they had the book .
unfortunately , most of you do n't have the courage to do this .
you ca n't talk about the der of the woman .
only some people have the courage .
you 've got at least in the universities .
and sometimes , we found a bunch of noise in the way that we found in the sample about haben , like here .
and then it goes down over algae into the . .
and these are the individuals .
they 're going to spread it
but i 'm looking at the time .
they 're all auf rocks , and that 's why i 'm working on a lot of other satellites , this issue .
the need . .
but my das is this one .
i 'd like to share the great message of the highest der of islam in the book of islam , at the end of islam .
not to be like müden , , but in the . .
if there are four million people together , men and women are islamische distribution .
and then what i did with all of those guys and the könig king of my life is going up between the tracks .
like i 've taken out this here , i 've got mail in the . .
unfortunately , the last , that would be the könig king .
but i 'm sure that if he würde it up .
to help these women .
for others , to show the world , which is the real values of islam , rather than having constantly seen .
by terrorists as . .
i mean , if i do n't create this , i could tell you that what i did is i 've done in egypt .
that , at least , many in in the sky in the world .
and we could visualize our immune there .
and i think it may be , you know , that little girl would n't have to escape his daughters .
and my life is so right now .
and i want to ask you to anybody who has heard this now or has seen it .
it turns out that it 's not a . .
we need to have the potential to get in the bigger , otherwise , from this stage .
and now i want to show you by the design of my schon .
this is my , , my . .
and this is in every da line on the sky in the name of the und , and i do n't even know that .
we then have in german .
female marbou is with the koran and the des of islam .
it 's und and a copy of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so let me start with that .
this is how the aus man that you got as a in in germany .
on the achten side , my mother and my brother and i first went to the first one .
it bestialisch . .
my mom was completely covered , because she did n't understand why we were given essen food .
on the third day , we were finally . .
we then wanted to put the stuff back , then a frau woman and put it out against aus .
they tried to explain how they could eat .
that 's not insignificant .
this is actually used very good .
it 's tedious .
my mom moved up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my own life , as we do it , it does n't have that gerochen dinosaurs .
i 'm kurban und and jahre years old .
fifteen years ago , i was with my mom and my brother from china to germany .
now , from that basis , i tell you today .
but most importantly , i 'm going to tell you the people who have this tendency and made a success .
but first of all , i tell you where i come from .
i am . .
sind are a small , that lives in the realm of china .
and this region is called the gebiet area .
it 's about kilometer miles away .
in china , in china , a number of 10 million of the world 's largest community is outside in china .
and this leben life is because we have to suffer in china .
hundreds of thousands of chinese have gone down to how we 'd become in our own home .
our own language , wurde became dem from the education system .
in schools and in universities , only chinese conversations .
and our religion , we need to be free .
they 're losing their culture and identity .
and if someone is living , and for the right is that , for the right , for the most of the cost of life , has been used for a long time or death .
it was also the reason that my parents decided for me to . us .
that was und and i was 11 years old .
the picture is a very short time ago .
we did n't have enough money , so my father had to leave me .
i 'm looking at a lot of people who have helped us who have been helped us .
i 'm looking at a lot of images .
i 'm very an to unseren on our schlepper .
i kind of give him exactly what my eyes are .
he was a big lederjacke , always , and we made him with his little auf on a reef .
the first is . .
i know a lot of a negative picture of people who have just do business do n't want to do business , they do n't really care about it .
but i 'm sorry to say , `` i want to call him as nennen , '' not as a . .
because they get rid of us crying .
he stood down at the airport in auf on a und , and it was until to the last end , whether we were really safe by the kamen .
and we came there and i know what my mother looks like to me , just out of the airport .
do n't .
until we get out of it
because i had a walk in my hand , and i was there in my photograph , but i was a close name , . .
i had to do like durch through . .
and i ' to give me a zollbeamten der of what he had to do in my hand .
silence .

a long one .
we finally durchgewunken .
in argentina , ' , i was looking at a lot of people who were kind of haben .
i ' to the frau woman who used with us in a hospital .
it 's in a mit with four pro per dreizehn families .
at least three children .
a und and a kitchen .
there was 600 faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mom , my brother and i had to share a teilen .
there were eaten , dick and chicken .
and my friends were n't going to go up because i was , , where we found .
it 's just my favorite der of the in in wusste .
she knew my story and she made me a lot , and she managed to me .
for example , they brought me to sportgymnastik what i do n't do .
but she also helped me , kind of , mitschüler kennenzulernen kennenzulernen .
i spent my whole interview in . .
this was not easy for my mom .
in fact , with children without their husband , and always in the process because we had only had a und , and they could be accepted .
i was ' myself that i really was very , very war .
it 's a little bit embarrassing to tell you , but now i 'll just stand to my story .
i was very privileged , and i was very interested in school .
we 've got that first to erziehungshilfe wo where we had the first time in normal children .
i do n't know if i was a children who did n't have to live in a wohnen .
i was also ' to the die that i have , and my brother sent up to be oder or geschickt .
only of that we get a little bit out of
i was also ' by multiple mitarbeiterinnen who have made us cold because our parents could n't have a heart attack .
or they just came out with us .
we 've always been surprised .
and i know how we went from the corner and waiting for these people , because , somehow , strangers took people for the time , and that was important to us .
after two years , my father finally came to germany .
but the problem was that he was von von by nach because it had n't had a place for him .
i was ' myself , very , very smooth , who managed to protect my father from nach to china , and it even came to us that he had to live with us .
i 'm ' myself at this time where i really was very , very happy because after six years ago , we had to move into a normal plane .
we got a für for three years , and we ended up a personal ship with one of his arms and one of her .
and i even had a room .
it was a very small and i did n't have home in , but it was good , i could fall my door .
and i ' , i mean , i did n't have that time , very well , but i had to leave the ohne without a verlassen .
i do n't really looked for a perspective .
there came to be a , , that i was going to put in immer , and it 's still going to work to the idea that i could get over the second meine program .
first of all , they called the . .
thank you for my teachers who believed me , and i was really not going to get into the time that i did n't get into the middle of the middle .
after that i came to . .
and before i was a kam , i was playing by my best friend bei .
ist is a organization or a project of organized straßenfußballs .
but i was n't a good thing to do that , and i 've just done because we had a place in which we could just go .
we had a bowl of what we could be able to konnten our rauslassen .
and the head of half taught us that we were able to tell our problems , and he went to us and could be a sort of . us .
and then i came to , , . .
and this is a project where young people are asked to get a chance to get weiterzubilden .
that was really , really well , and i realized , art is something that really runterbringt me .
through und and respect , a commodity came on us .
he made the film über about the life of my friends and me .
and the film won many walls .
we found that people were interested in for our history .
he was a very special sense because we had never seen people to have heard of us .
and that was a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to get anymore .
i want to make something out of my life .
a von of , , a für for cuba came on me for the idea of a von of the kammerspielen mitzumachen .
but since i was in the horizontal building , i ended up with a für , and the title is eins one to four .
so i was exactly right .
i was playing .
and the great thing is that , after a performance , two vom are bayrischen mich .
and i had asked if i could have been able to have any zu .
i thought , great , . .
i 'm sorry .
and i made up for the on-drei-radio , , and now radiobeiträge und and one of my pieces of a play , , where i was in the european . for the european of the european .
and i actually won him .
now i 'm looking at college college , and film dokumentarfilmregie , in the third year and is der in the third year .
and this is not possible for me to do not like either , or organizations like oder or projects for me .
they 've believed to me , they made me open spaces , they showed me how i can kann my place in society .
and that 's where i come to you .
each of them has the ability to get people like me to help second opportunity and to find their lives or their place in society .
because , the people , at least , have to come up with a hundred inches to indonesia , and each of them are full of hope and each of them have a huge potential .
they 've made a lot of terrible geschafft behind them .
and with this circle , they could really be large für for germany and for every single one of us .
and i could tell you some of the things that you can do , but i do n't have any more time to do that there , a minute of , , i 've brought you a mitgebracht .
now check your phone phones , and you ca n't tell me that they can make a code .
put out the code , and then you come to the side of mit with lots of ideas you can do .
and this would be really good .
i 've been looking for your engagement now , and we 'll see where i 'm going to see
and watch the code .
i feature .
a lot of them do n't have cell phones .
are you so completely , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
ja .
it 's only a gruß meinerseits .
i 'm sorry that we 're living .
my name is . .
my ist is sich than it talks .
i am coming from jordan , which is in tokyo .
now , i 'm very pleased to have a very , very good thing to be today today .
i 'm going to give you a very simple one .
and that 's not a prediction , this is a feeling .
yeah , yeah , in contrast to the other , i 'm not going to be here to give you about something .
i did n't know what .
but it 's so that i write a little bit of text in my pieces , and this is where i 'm going to talk to the next presentation , mostly at slams oder or oder or events like today .
yeah , and i was asked to be here today , a few ago , to make the whole program a little bit more . .
and that 's exactly what i 'm going to do here .
yeah .
let me start with a joke .
these are two magnets .
so let me give you , you know , two of them , you know , `` well , two of them , '' and `` do n't , , '' but they do n't have , you in in bed in . .
let 's hear .
`` it just is n't about me . ''
here we have this level of . .
the first text is a little , i wrote .
i 've got it at a person who is part of what he does .
it carries the title .
and yeah , she did n't understand it .
when your head was in my hands , my rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my dein 's leg outside the ceiling .
my leg was long with the ceiling .
it 's your head . it 's based on my lap , the rest of you in the ceiling , my leg is also under the ceiling , your leg outside the ceiling .
this is , , when it was in my leg .
it was very . .
the next text i did was i put a person who was a lot .
that 's my . .
we do n't have a chance to do .
my favorite grandfather was metzger . .
already as a child , he brought with love geschnitten .
just so , yeah .
yeah , with text text .
it 's better .
jesus is the only steht on the top of the glass of the bus .
but where was it when he was going to save me in front of that hätt ' ?
are you thinking , yes ?
did i have to do my schon ?
next text .
the next text is a little longer .
he actually takes a hours .
so , to writing writing .
reading goes faster .
it 's the beginning of a novel that i described in the schreib .
ah , it 's about 120 guys , so the youngest of one guy who 's going to come back to the hair and do a little too much . .
i 'm always ' myself at this point that i 'm coming around .
because i never shut up the hair .
chapter one .
if i get wird , my head becomes empty .
so empty like the piece that it 's trying to fill .
yeah , i 'm not there .
very hard for hours .
the next text is a little . .
people do n't understand it .
i do enjoy myself .
and that 's what i 'm going to do , i 'd like to say , `` i 'm like , '' i 'd like to say , `` i 'm like , '' i 'd like
i 've always been playing with myself .
and yeah , there are things like this .
it carries the title .
it 's a little bit strange .
it may be the sprachspiel , , which i 've ever written .
we .
yeah , we . .
let 's see .
we . .
now i 'm going to do something else .
but i can .
i 'm not able to
i do n't .
yeah , i did n't understand it .
no idea .
yeah , yeah , von from me .
i always say , either everyone or no .
the next piece , though , is to do with text .
it 's kind of a small . .
i was writing this at insects .
very low .
yeah , with text text .
is a little . .
and it 's only cool when i 'm going to do that for three say .
my text is den , all the good things are cool .
so what we 've done is , what we 've done is , they 're . .
we is chel . .
so followed , chel , und and und , and then all the better and yes , that was it .
beautiful pieces of time .
yes , mitmachtext , , that 's another one .
and it 's really cool if i do so that we could make all of this kind of machen , so let 's try all the time .
that 's exactly what the wind is doing .
the text is wearing `` und '' and it goes .
yeah .
power is fun .
the average text is just a sentence .
i would like to write a little . .
this is a sexuelles paradox .
goliath is written with s geschrieben .

yeah , yeah .
power is fun .
yeah .
it 's written in geschrieben .
it 's a very long sentence .
i think it 's a bit impossible to explain , to explain rein , that 's the point .
here 's another text .
that day is a . .
the title from the text .
this day is a und , and he knows it .
he already knew it before i have this habe .
he gave me some of his time , then he would lassen me .
i can put myself later into him .
i made the joy .
it und as a vor from any other days , and i was . myself .
with a grinsen im in the face of the face ?
and intent , he no longer to give him by aufwache .
and i was going to conclude again , and it 's not going to have a dancing day .
is hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
now , what would be called a film when he was n't used to him ?
i whistled .
so .
it sounds out to be q sounds like the cow .
that 's the fun thing .
yeah , the next text also has learned the paper .
it 's something political .
so i write not just weird things .
i write very , very political things .
and i 'll often ask where i 'm ' .
and yeah , yeah , i just wrote this text here .
he carries the zu-meiner-herkunft .
my father came from massachusetts , and then my mother and i came out of her .
yeah .
we would have that . .
thank you for sound .
yes , in this point , what i 'd like to do is make a
i ca n't afford business business or so , so i need to do that .
and that 's what i also love for myself , and i also do a slam in .
i love to play .
and yes , i ' , i 'm really sympathisch .
and , yeah .
i just want to say that .
it 's on the program .
more advertising .
that 's a little advertising i wrote .

rich .
so the . .

well , pretty funny .
i want to write a joke about the deiner of your friend , but the prison line was just flat .
yeah , it 's not my . .
you have gärungsprozess you have have have the the out message of it .
yeah .
thank you for listening .
they were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me start with a frage question .
why do you want to run überhaupt at all ?
i mean , anybody who 's used to have money , whether he 's going to have a society of society .
and the answer is clear .
we know now that life is only about prozent percent determiniert .
that means , you need to have some environmental effects , which have access to the influence .
now why do we know so much ?
why is it that , why is it that we 're going to go to the nachrichten of nachrichten messages that makes up part of each other ?
you all remember , 15 years ago , the gefunden process .
it was fat .
and you thought , if you get fat out of food , we 'll all be part and you 'll be healthy .
what has happened to the von of absurden regalen with different in in american arabia , and what has nothing has changed is that the americans have gone every year .
you know , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the low-power .
what happens to wie like the der of the , and the und and so on .
so it 's always going to have a new sau from the village .
how about all of this ? ?
now the reason for me , for my mind , is that we . ansätze anekdotische anekdotische anekdotische zu zu .
so , an example of a einzelfall prison .
the kennen you all know .
veröffentlichte published a lot of zeitschrift wrote a new . .
the top der of todeskandidaten für for the next year .
jennifer edison had been around for seven years .
then they died the newspaper .
or this lady here .

the oldest man who ever lived on earth .
jahre years old .
i know there are people who say they 're six , but they ca n't find their nicht .
it 's a geworden ist .
and she listened to fing auf , but with wieder dem , the path of trying to follow and stop zu .
with ist they died .
so what does this tell us ?
not that gesund are healthy .
but it tells us that strangers is very complicated , and that we need to need to be commercial statistics , and we need to ask simple questions .
it 's a simple question , and it 's a very simple thing to do , that in many countries , women are older than men .
what is this ?
we know it now .
and that 's basically what 's going on in the field of what 's going on in the male .
and there are signs of simple evidence to that , as it turns out , it 's as old as women .
now , everybody can think that this is a anti-aging-weg ist .
calpers is a land country .
but there 's even better news , no fear .
now , we 're going to be able to mit ourselves down with zu .
sounds complicated , but it 's easy to illustrate the normal flow .
so there was somebody who asked oma and wonder about what was they going to do so different or anything else that they were so old ?
court .
the cia has 10 geraucht . every day .
this is probably the secret of your age , right ?
in those words , the ten americans may not have . .
or , `` but they have und , and the advertising would n't get the ten percent .
even the statistics are not always . .
for example , for example , they 've got very hard statistics , which is that people who are going to be older in besuchen are older than people who do n't .
unmistakable .
it 's . .
is that das ? ?
no .
it 's because people are just enough money in your pocket to be good about their age and the erkrankungen conditions .
but if i was to give a group of einen into a food company , and these group have spent 20 percent longer than if they did n't get it right now , but otherwise , in fact , i was actually going to get a faktor factor in the diet .
and in fact , that 's what they 've been done .
you 've got to tell you , the ist is very worin , but even though i 'm aware of my enemies is that fasten are made of life .
and this works for all kinds of organisms .
for example , in bacteria .
you can see there 's von of bacteria .
if we look at the age of the linie line , they have a lot of life .
and the same is true of , , fliegen , and recently , about two years ago in the united states , that it 's even for monkeys .
it 's not about being sweet .
it also works in der of the küche kitchen .
and this is another experiment , which has been done in the united states .
what did you do here ?
you 've got mausgruppe , and you have this kind of high-fat-diet , , a diät diet where you 've got so many hier here and night .
and who 's brilliant , who has become a childhood , sick , and they 've had some terrible gehabt gehabt and bad . .
now , you 've got a very serious number , and that 's exactly the same number of gefüttert to nur only that it was pause .
they were n't going to eat their food , that they 've eaten the day twice .
and these nun now is lower and healthy , and they 're not a . .
even though they were mäuse .
they 've got a lot of food .
one sick and the other healthy .
so what happens ?
it becomes a process called selbstreinigung oder or angeschaltet .
and as soon as they take organisms or cells , then the organism starts to send the organism out of the cell or bestandteile areas to make energy more energy .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
and you can see , in the cell , in the same way in the cell , it 's mostly a common way to , , which is during the age of time .
and the dann then started to dem the maggots and put the cell as energy .
by the way , they 'll put teachers in the age of the age .
this is actually the swiss der of , , or the von of the oft parts .
so , in many ways , it 's regelmäßiges , in many ways .
and it 's probably , to assume that it 's working with people .
and what we 're learning is that they 're not going to fight in empfohlen every little am on the day .
no .
but , you want to tell you , if you have hunger , ah , maybe it 's going to hit the angeschaltet .
claim your hunger as a friend .
and that makes a sinn sense .
during komma , nine nine percent of the human history is the human man , if he was hungry ?
that 's exactly what he is doing .
we 're going to try to buy our hands if we 're hungry .
and that 's certainly against biology .
now , of course , we know , and this is in the bible , in kapitel , sechsundzwanzig , , the mind , and the meat is weak .
the garden looks very different .
here we 've seen from brueghel in in a paradies garden .
it 's really good to the three to the three to the top day .
and that 's kind of the real . .
so we 've got a look looking for granted , which is the molecular response of the anschalten memory era .
it could be interesting for people to be interesting with , their nicht .
and it could be perhaps perhaps one of the wegkreuzungen des of life .
so the question is , we can use the , , the , , the selbstverdau , and when you eat ?
and we have a lot of hundred , a little thousand of them , natural engagement .
we found it in case that the spermidin .
now , ist is a matter that is produced in all organisms , but also in all organisms are less in all organisms .
in the skin , it 's in . .
menschen people have less in in the skin than . .
and if we give auf to human cells , for example , look at that .
this is serious cell here .
it 's the , , and we 're going to give us spermidin , and we 're seeing a lot of thousands of this little in in the cell that 's going to come out of the age of the age .
now , zellen cells would look like this .
and that works in many organisms .
so , for example , here 's a little . .
so we 've seen the gefunden gefunden die die .
life because organisms are too much .
and the answer is , again , you see the typical von of a . .
they 're simple . .
after tagen days , all of the dead people are dead , for example , half dead .
whenever we put ins to the network , they 'll be able to see where animals are older and survive .
we also know that human cells that we have of ex individual gezapft , in culture , about three times as long as we put them together .
and the final research research also , again , is that even the life 's life is going through by the life .
and it 's not just life , it 's also the . .
these are immunkompetenter . .
so .
now , of course , do you want all of us , what 's going on ?
as the name says , it 's been discovered in orbit , it 's in very high levels .
but i can , them , also in frischem , and a product made out of sojabohnen , , which has great genießt , which is , of course , kommt kommt .
and then we told you , when gegen can help hilft , by using the aufräumt hilft , then do n't want to ? ?
what you have to know is that the common divergence of all erkrankungen diseases is that during the age of im in the brain .
and we 've done these experiments .
they 're going to wonder we 've done that .
they 're also , when they 're old .
they have more im in the brain when they 're old .
and the toxic contribution that are involved in memory are very similar to people .
now you ask yourself , how to the devil , what is the guy 's wrong ?
this is the experiment that we 've made together with disease 's von von .
you take a hundred und and you put that up there , and you give a smell that you love .
deworming .
and let 's put it into a aalen .
and then they take the same fly , they give them in the next stages and give them to give them some other points that they love , which is . .
we 'd like to do this genießen while she zuckerbelohnung zuckerbelohnung .

then you take the same fly , and you do that .
you can see the running right here right here .
and if you 've got down here , you give it from one side and from another side .
where do they all go ?
yeah .

except the two ones here .
these are the . .
or , say , you have a character .
i love my und , and i do n't want to do it by the belohnung reward . .
okay .
but also , the form of character that goes with the age of the age .
not just in the fly .
and we actually could , in fact , the der of the fly from auf to a , , to a , , level .
and the , that were made in the brain were . .
it 's not just , , but it 's not just alterung , you know .
and that 's important because we do n't want to reduce the nicht of the living .
it does n't make sense to reduce the time in the time .
and i do n't want to leave you , without giving some of the work that we might be younger .
let 's have a little more time .
it 's not that you get weight .
there are , in austria , von group of leuten people who ate a day and a day .
this is the so-called unter under the line of germany and accountability .
and they hold very well .
that means it 's . .
you can be . .
it 's not about conventional complex tumors in the same way .
it 's really about unbelievable .
you know that hinreichend sind are sind , even if they 're sind .
and you also know that sugar can make growth of tumors .
here you see , wurmpopulation die , vor .
after 30 days , all of them are dead .
very low , dosen .
to create a effekt effect .
there 's only one example that works almost all of these organisms .
eat out disease and vegetables .
avoid the gift of many oder or vitamintabletten .
you know , we know that -- -- and krebs cancer can produce .
this is not among the conditions for vitamin d .
we may be here at the winter center , because vitamin d is created by sunlight on the skin .
some three times three times half 10 hour ago , and that 's hard .
because of the early beispiele examples , they do n't live 10 to 10 years .
do you .
the impact of wonder and pressure on the life is shot .
because venus life is almost as long as women .
, , alkoholtrinker , , live longer than . .
leben lives longer than . .
but they still live longer than . .
only sterben of dying were used as a . .
what is this ?
people think that what happens to do is to do with some
no , no , it 's very simple .
now , if i 'm here today , a am on the window is ' , i 'm mit .
and what happens is , what happens is that happening in your field .
ablagerungen , , und and the way that they 're going to get out of unter under people .
that 's what happens to do in terms of 'ne . .
you have a complicated partner , or you can have familie family .
they should not live in a much straße road .
now you 're going to do a look at you .
but that 's not to do with gar .
it 's lärmbelastung .
you can measure the closer from a much straße street , the more hat he has in blood .
and that 's when he says , i used to make my attention .
i can do good quickly and the noise do n't make me anything .
it 's not .
it has more im in blood and it 's bad .
arabic should be fixed because of course .
we know that sehr sehr has very well very well .
all of a sudden it can increase the senken .
and we also know that we can do this research , and we also know how to protect the schützen .
this knew by the process of our frustration , also , with us and so forth .
not without meaning .
and several studies show that dark chocolate can cause for heart disease .
just recently , a beautiful study has shown that if half of the ice is dark chocolate per day , the eines of one auf could bring the level of a bringen .
now , what you do is , you want to do something like this .
there are studies that show that there are studies that do n't show that .
what 's clear is that it 's going to function coffee against diabetes , and it 's possible to produce its mental performance .
and up , by the way , it 's a very good subject because it creates aus of how we could get together with kroemer aus .
we 've had a very nice time in the hundred people who have been shown for the hundred and a half of people who have been shown to the hundred years of six years .
this is a huge value for conventional research study .
and that 's true for , , pistazien , haselnüsse , macadamia , walnüsse , walnüsse .
but not yet , the gesehen are actually the most successful .
they 're just going to give up their own children , ok ?
but that 's actually true .
so fortunately , this is not .
the next point is a little extreme .
you 're going to avoid the camera from much of the kind of animal protein , so it 's fleisch , it 's only when it 's between und and jahre .
there 's a really nice new study showing that if you 're going to have a lot of animal proteins , you take your so so strong than you were having a huge deal .
it 's not that they 're good at the time where these are these proteins are good , and it 's not for children 's kids or teenagers , the animal proteins , and it 's not for sale and those who want to be .
what they 're doing is , they 're sie .
what they 're doing is , they 've got das , which is , in fact , that they 've said the smell , the , , the misstrauen , the sind of the health .
it 's all gehört right now .
this is the salvatore der der who lived about this block , and he 's got jahre years old .
it comes from my home from my home 's , .
and it 's really good .
he 's not not a einzelfall drop at all , but he lives in a , , where there 's some healthy gibt .
it 's about the gefolgt board that i told you today .
we do n't want to be in all the experimenten experiments that do n't even exist at all .
that is , the des of the mir of my country does not have to be biological , but it 's a . .
you give the old people less , and it may be one of the most vulnerable mistakes of our culture .
schrieb wrote the biggest novel in ein a year ago .
the brothers . .
a piece of work , at the way , vor vor die .
thank you for listening .
so i want to start with a question that i can tell you .
one question , where no one needs to get up , because it 's a little scary thing who is who is evil ?
it 's very small .
less than i thought .
it 's probably not reasons why they do n't have haben , but the people who would have to deal with it as well .
so a lot of people do alleinsein and und and think of that .
that 's not the case .
now , here is actually a phenomenon of a phenomenon in people as alone .
maybe it 's also because they 're not haben because the question is ist .
do you feel secure , or are you agreed ?
you can feel fühlen without zu .
and you can be surprised without feeling zu .
faiza also has a lot to do with it .
now , a few now now , some of us will have haben themselves .
erick leads to und and führt .
mark need time .
so now there 's nobody going here in the few seconds that i gave you .
erick needs . .
insulin uses the time to be aware of her .
and insulin uses also need exercise to talk about that .
and we do n't do this kind of practice .
we do n't have the language yet we have signs for ourselves , so when we have a sense of noise ?
there are two , that i 've ever been sitting on .
the one part of humanity says , you 're from the beginning of memory .
from the birth to death , they 're actually . .
there are few moments in your life where you can .
so these people are often going to und and sich the whole day .
i did n't even have time . it 's your . .
and then there are people less , who say everything is connected to everything .
i do n't really have it , so i 'm just part of the big universe .
and these are the great group that i 've been looking at some of the time ,
the thinking is , okay today , i 'm happy and the next day , oh , it 's all about each other .
if we think about insulin thinking , it turns out to be a big soldier .
the owner of the river , the der of the person on an act .
but beyond these , , these large möcht , i 'm really not talking about , but i want to talk about the small ones that we have about the everyday stages , where obesity can be in a theater .
i do n't want to talk about the indians and the des of the . .
mark in other results , most of us do n't feel very hard to us .
now , the hundreds of astronomers introduced a few pictures i want to show you .
how easily it would always determine in others .
and we all do n't know whether these people really felt false in that moment .
but who knows it does n't know , the moment in this particular event where you think , all talk to each other , only you lose yourself something lost up in the corner .
you know , all of a sudden , you know , you know , you know , you know , these
maybe some of them have already been well .
so what you 're doing is , the mobile phone does a lot of the mobile phone , you could actually see this very well as well as a , , which is a vor on the cell phone .
clearly , if you look at the screen .
what we do n't do here .
yeah , and then there is the abstraction , which is the number of the number of a auf in bühne , hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of people , and you give something out of hope that you do n't forget .
these are the , that you see from the outside .
we are . other people .
but i 'm sure there are people in the room who are looking at some of the things that their whole lives would have made that they 've tried , that von of what they 're trying to do is they 're trying to adapt to them .
and there are also people who are surprised , because they have to feed a different person , it 's because death or because of a sudden .
and it also uses nothing that even so many people , even people , with whom they 're connected to them around them , they feel they feel .
and there are people who are trying to find themselves in terms of themselves .
i ' the digital wing .
and below your hand , you 'll bring the mic out .
the usda is familiar with us .
these are people who believe their opinion in social business .
it 's always relatively .
there is no dumb number , there are no zahl number when someone has given human human hat .
we immediately immediately see the old people .
it 's the informal form of death .
but since that , we all live in cities with a lot of people at facebook or by twitter or facebook , this digital decline has always been bigger .
you can be connected to hundreds of people without having a single person .
it 's a lot to be the von of human relationships , and that 's missing to the digital layer of the relationships .
the two forms of deaths are very often at each other .
and that turns out that mathematicians are a little daherkommt player .
whereas digital prices are good for und and sadness .
it 's that the digital country in the future has to be more powerful than the opportunities to connect , bigger .
i do n't know if you 'll be this feeling in 20 years , that it will be very similar to us .
or whether you find a new term .
but these are also the problems of generation generation .
it 's almost bigger than the fifth self is the fear of the resistance and of that fear being people to do some other things .
, , the large , , also a mensch leader has written a wonderful geschrieben .
in fact , they do what people do all to be not alone .
they 're building , you know , kids that are sind and left .
but what they did n't write was they said to , the fear of the wing , which is money .
gehen go .
things like that .
and the process that we 've seen is because it 's kind of like , at least , it 's kind of einen and the objects that you have chosen .
but the problem is that it 's going to do very well and it 's going to do that this gegen against the . .
that 's why we need to buy some new things .
i saw the advertising company for one of the most unterhosen college college .
and the ganz effect is completely von from mobile phone with the obvious part of it .
now , what that does to do in order is that you do n't know , but apparently it works .
so insulin has n't do anything to do with the zu of one of these things like that .
kästner hat has written a wonderful poem , and there 's a description in the worst side of land .
hand on your heart , who knows that ?
in a relationship or or the other thing , or the other thing , or the other in zu , can suddenly feel terrible and feel terrible and the question is , who 's the person in it ?
did i have something to do with anything ?
one study is that , at all , women are women around who , married and children .
because of course , because i do n't know anymore , if i did n't have the study of the study , i 've done it so often .
but now it 's also not because it 's mostly at least at the studies of research , and the reaction always always is that people mir me .
that the script is so completely , is almost a . .
right ?
let me tell you a little bit little about the history of sex .
well , that 's probably what everybody happened .
still , while you 're ist , suddenly what do i actually do ?
who is this person in my bed ?
also , a form of lentils is not necessarily what you have to do with the quality of your mind .
not nothing to have done with the quality of relationship .
it 's just there .
we do n't talk about them because we do n't see them .
we do n't talk right about them in the workforce .
in the 1990s , the driver is also als as we think .
i was so on so kongresszentrum , and there was a group of five , , better i 'm talking about three anzug , and two kostüm .
the two men have a conversation , the two women who have ever talked about .
and in between britain , something a little bit mit with the in in .
i mean , i do n't have to take you this picture , and you 've got to have this kind of wing that everyone else has already seen in its classroom .
it 's the des of . .
but it 's also the tip of the iceberg .
we all know the oder , or i see here , we may also sit in some of these guys .
in , , in hotels in kenya , which often do n't even know who they 're really , what they 're doing .
where they are .
this is a form of stockholm that 's not talked about .
it 's only that they can be able to be , , as opposed as to be missbraucht .
and i want to say that this is necrophilia .
i 've been told a question to say that he was calling by a customer , and who said it 's what is going on , you ca n't imagine it .
a war was alone in the conference .
it turns out to be freigegeben .
and two months later , he 's shocked .
the electron is never going to be here .
it always comes in with other emotions .
she has beautiful videos , and she has horrible glue .
the ones we know is everybody .
you can be afraid , pure anger and the experience .
but we should not forget the nice hypothesis .
the freedom to the die is the desire for the . .
that 's what i 'm going to look at in terms of interest .
and it goes in life like the dark and it goes .
let 's put them up , and let 's not take it from you .
because there is something much worse than the horizon , and that is the empty , you might have no idea anything .
insulin is part of life .
since i was thinking , i 've been thinking about it for two things .
one in my career , i do n't know anymore , i do n't know , i always call somebody why he did n't have any head because i thought maybe i thought i would have heard the people , maybe i 'm ' .
i 've spent it since , since , since , i 've taken the eggs in my life to come and go forward .
that 's exactly how it 's like the , you do .
again , i have become free .
people come and walk away , they 're not going to be able to check out whether they could have a oder , a oder , or something like that .
as a child , i found incredibly embarrassing .
you can not start with someone 's vorbeigehen without somebody else .
whether in the oder or in the economy .
every time , it led to be quiet .
as a child , i found the way i said .
as a young age , i was making you incredible to have this openness ,
but just since that , i was doing it myself for myself to do it with me , and then also open me up .
you can see the god so you 're ready for the next .
thank you .
yeah , thank you .
i 've got three miles here .
a einen and a und and a . .
and now , i 'm going to ask you , if it 's going to get , what is you going to get here to you ?
most of them would decide for the entscheiden .
and that 's a pretty good idea .
and why ?
because we get the biggest effect with the thing .
we somehow do this differently .
that 's where the world works with the biggest effect of eight and decide to others .
we choose to give us an example of the und and the für .
big , big aid .
not so much .
or we 're going to choose to . ourselves .
that 's for diet .
but very large , very large , very large effort .
for me , not so much .
and i want to tell you today about how you can get the biggest erzielen .
if you 're involved with prevention and health , you do n't get to look at a topic .
and the subject is desertification .
and the theme was reduced in germany for a while , that 's how much up to the . .
and then the number of deaths in germany were an .
and i was wondering , what was going on there ?
so why did n't we put that suddenly up ?
and then i was studying , and i 've become geworden .
because it was in the year .
what was there ?
there came nach in germany .
and we 're going to do it always and do it ?
and i just looked at it .
kommt comes through germany .
and it 's getting limited .
and in the year , the curve takes really right to go on .
and then what happens to germany ?
und and und and und and , , and as it does .
and we 're going to do it always and do it ?
well , i got one and one .
because it was clear .
sports power .
and of course , i 'm not here today to tell you that playing disease .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we noticed in common now .
the density of these and new ecosystems -- and they did n't have what we 're going to be werden and healthier .
so what is it ?
the diet ?
and there 's also a great study in the u.s .
again , the problem with parenting .
and they 've introduced into the low-fat-produkte eingeführt .
and then you want to look at a moment , what 's going to happen ?
and you 've seen , people are actually making less fat , but people are still spending less calories , but they 're always threatened .
and that was a paradox .
and that 's why they called genannt .
so we can explain that ?
you can imagine the body as a power force .
and we 've been here that we do n't have big . .
and on one side , a , , we do all of the drauf that are going down here .
and this is where the energy gets als as electricity .
now , if we put more hier here in our power here , we put it on the other side , we use the energy in the power and the power system .
the human body does n't invent the same idea .
it can reduce energy .
it 's in the form of skin .
our biggest and energiespeicher . .
what happens when we heard less than we heard it , it 's energy , and yet it turns out , it takes us to end .
the hat has increased dramatically .
there 's no life in place .
we 're just alive .
and that 's exactly what that happens .
our grandparents went up to a kilometer mile .
and we 're going to come up with one more to two kilometers , and those are the positive treatments .
there are studies that went from five -- to metern feet .
i 'm going to tell you a little bit of a mit with my friend .
do you give me more enough to the chair ?
mike , come out of the number .
mike is americans .
he 's shy , he 's not going to speak much .
and he was at the study of this study , and here 's now here .
he 's this typical cowboy-stiefel , , karohemd cowboy-hut und and he has a in in the hand .
and radio food is still eating less and more and more , and yet it 's always , and always matter .
why ?
because mike is only sitting .
and i 've just looked at how much motion would be like this day , and it 's got a break in the pocket , and at the end of the night , i left again .
and there was a thousand steps .
this was like the distance , california hat in the morning to the car with the car to the office , and there was a little coffee and going back and back .
and he came up with a thousand steps .
that means mike had 10 minutes on his legs .
stunden hours and 65 minutes were oder and mike .
now , among these conditions , they form .
and mike is n't going to be because he 's going to eat a lot , because so long , it 's a long time , and it 's not used by the way , and it 's not using the energy of the energy .
and first of all , the energy , the way you see it in your . .
but energy is , , which is n't there .
the sich give up in blut blood .
and again , she 's active and still and an in its . .
so the blowfish .
so when you put the energy into the blood , then the doctors are talking from high blood water and high . .
and this , , the da , is like , , and these little holes are happening in these . .
and a happiness is still moving the whole fat , and it 's a little und and we 're talking about oder or . .
and now , herz heart is right under pressure because it has to be the blood through these verklebten gefäße houses , and we 're talking about blood pressure .
and if that fish , you can see a trifft , it will be in the body .
and when that happens in heart , we call the heart heart .
and if that 's what happened , we call the script .
and in germany , every second of the heart and a half second is in germany .
that means , in germany , every second is energiestau .
and then it turns out , and it 's not so sick because it does n't make a musician -- because it does n't move anymore .
and if you do n't know that stuff , it 's always looking at the wrong place .
for example , the theme .
i was still going to give you a number of diet at office , and there 's suchtreffer deutschsprachige diätliteratur , .
and if each book is only just a piece of artist , and we 'd like to have this , , we would have a 30 meters of the turm of turm . .
and i 've read the time for them .
and it 's in there , and that 's really important if you give more energy , so you get more food than you eat it .
and if they give less energy than they consume it .
that 's neat .
but why do we need bücher books ?
it just makes you end one .
and of course , the need is huge , of course .
because why does a diet deserve to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet and no life .
so what they 're doing is they 're doing this for three weeks , and here we are at five weeks if we can , after this struggle , back to the normal life , into our normal lives .
what 's going on to five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
at least und and again , again , we do n't have what we did .
so every new diet , one of us , can be able to ask us to any new diet , and they can ask it to their lives in their own lives .
yes , or no ?
and if you go .
and if you do n't .
because if it does n't go out , it 's kind of zeitverschwendung .
they 're the couples who think whether we 're sick or healthy .
these are the bad conditions that make us feel sick .
and these are the good conditions that make us healthy .
and if you look at the mirror of the mirror , it will be the result of his hands .
if you look at the mirror in the mirror , it 's going to see its daily habits .
and when monkeys look into the mirror and be honest , it 's also where it 's running on .
because if he has more bad habits as well , he 's in a direction of disease .
and if you want to go to the direction of health care towards his goals , it 's not going to change your entire life .
and he just takes more good habits than bad .
and a gewohnheiten scientist diplomacy is also a great example of the human being a strange animal .
mike , it has done it for example , an movement completely by its living indem by putting every way to the car and use each of the car .
and at night he 's running on the couch and has to come to the movement .
so he 's going to ins in his fährt , and they put it up there , and then it turns out , and then you have a eingespannt , and then you would put fish back in such a band so that it 's kind of moving into motion .
and my career would have exactly the same as me .
and it was a farmer who did n't understand .
that would have said , sports is for people who do n't move .
and somehow it 's right .
why do we have to spend past in our most precious places that we have achieved in time ?
in addition , we had to take these lebensstil animals for two hours per day .
so it 's a much easier to find the movement that we have .
in the same time .
and that 's why , i 'm listening to you today today .
you know , you might , you know , you 're going to do the situation , and you 're going to drive back quickly a little bit quickly , and you 're going to notice that in the first row there 's no place .
and so what we 're looking at here is , of course , dieser this in .
we always want to leave that time .
we plan our cells to be the wege species .
we plan our whole life so that we have the wege species , but that 's not what we 're not going to do when we . .
it 's in a very different way .
and so you can actually activate the aktivieren , and find the movement to the movement where they 're auftaucht .
for example , i like to get out of it .
and i 'm the only ones to get up and down and down and down and down everyone else .
but if i 've been there , then i can tell you that .
and then i ' the movement which is just like that .
and if it comes to the kommt , 30 minutes , i 'm . .
schritte steps .
that 's about three times 10 times 10 minutes .
and a dreitausend schritte , if you go to every day every day , you 'll be able to go to the end of the day 12 , you 're not going to be in your body .
this might sound a little bit .
but as an , , as a chemist , dreihundertsechzig days in the year , we 're talking about four fünf five pounds .
we do n't have that in our bodies .
and you give me a degree of that , you know , i 'm fettknochen it .
the americans are crazy , and they 're like this .
this is a von from five pounds of fat .
that 's what i was four .
just so you see what happens to these little steps .
and if that 's the effect from this perspective , what you can do , if you really started to do something like this .
and these die , they get rid of each day each day .
and as soon as they got a little bit of a day , they go close to each other .
and if you can do that , and then at a time , you make it on the top .
then they also have . the auch .
then they 'll also be faster and stronger .
but they do n't make their health more dependent .
so they do n't make their health anymore from their thoughts and from their time .
because the most important thing to do is to make this happen every day .
and i ' .
and to me , it 's more than a shift for me to make a das that is based on a clear decision for life and for myself .
because i think health does n't have to do it with what we should need to do or do .
but health has done what we want to do .
and so today , i 'm just going to give you an idea for you .
you 'll just pick up just for the best .
and then you know what it is .
step forward .
thank you .
how did it have a leonardo out there , in the way , could be able to see the world in so incredible , wonderful way in the world with other eyes ?
and in fact , even so far on the neighborhood , what happened to be just , at all time ?
could we do it today ?
do you think that might happen with trauma ?
and how can we make that power and access to our future ?
so let 's start with the question of what we actually do with innovation ?
yeah .
technology 's technology research and development even the so-called der of government has called the title of government .
so understand me .
that 's all great .
and we can be with quite proud of it , and we may be grateful that we have in in such a lot of systems that we 've been needed to be really good at all of us .
that we 've got such incredible , unique wealth .
but what about the future ?
which challenges will come to us as a society to us ?
and who does n't care about the big force and social challenges ?
so they seem to be kind of zu .
a kind of choice .
so the economy is moving around the ecological challenges because of the entrepreneurs , we then have a great amount of effort that we then reduce productivity and efficiency .
and they want to make the world better , and they want to be able to find the world themselves in between organizations and und and und and so forth what businesses is doing so much , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course
at least zu .
but who says we need to look at all this ?
how would it be that if we 're going to grow our way into social and cultural growth ?
if technological innovation is at the same time , cultural innovation is
if economic innovation is also the same social innovation ?
so , if we could think of this , how do we think , we think , would we think about the solution of great goods and social challenges ?
and if it 's really different to other people , and if it 's really different to us , as far as we can get it out of , rather , ausbalancierte 's development ?
because what was this ?
both they did n't want to have a company , right ?
can that be ?
ask yourself .
so far , we 've always seen this .
well , fortunately , for example .
paul introduced his , with his , , with his in in bangladesh , incredibly um to poverty .
and interestingly , a lot of the time in the very least more than the federal government has done .
and he 's got als as a entrepreneur , probably , for instance , for the peace .
in fact , in the opportunity , i will be able to do something like this .
in turn , i can imagine brenner . .
ganz young guy .
that 's great , but it was also his ideal .
and yeah , so totally . .
i love that .
and if you see that , you might think about it in the face , because we do n't have to worry about our future .
yes , in the study , he started to work somewhere in one of our hidden champions . .
that makes a good thing .
that 's what it 's like to him , and it 's also very successful .
and yet , this is where it 's in him .
so he 's saying , is there more likely to be in this one ?
so this is what the u.s. level does .
sind are in .
and that 's what it 's like .
and he also kind of like this .
so the right there is the , , which is the same thing .
so he 's not going to know him personally , but that 's what he tells you about .
and there it is in the middle of the t three den that he did n't .
so , it was more likely to be surprised as he was given his head at persönlich .

and as a result , he 's a unternehmer entrepreneur .
this is a great pleasure , so with young people to work , this was his experience .
and the two , then , aneinander .
and they 've always met each other .
how would it be that if we just ? in one of these conversations from the two times ?
yeah , mr. , , like that , like that .
now , what is the difference between the und and general companies ?
i did n't understand that .
so yeah , so what we 're going to do is we start to ask a question in the question of etabliertes companies ?
so here 's already .
institutional markets , pure products , french customers , fantastic structures , there 's a . .
and you can also do exactly exactly the same thing that the big shapes .
and once they had , , even though the whole thing is clear , it can also turn .
so , what is it going to be a ? ?
so , du , you 've got it , is it 's not the small eines of a large company .
it 's something completely different .
it has a completely different character .
because it does n't have any . .
no single customer , no geschäftsmodel , , nothing 's known .
so , of course , a eine organization is a constant organization that 's trying to be able to look for a business model , finding it , is , of course , it 's mostly ist , and then it 's spread .
and you 're certainly going to understand that , of course , there are some other ways in which there are other ways to other species , very different , very different .
yeah , that 's clear .
but after what is we really looking at ?
so , i 'm ' , and it 's going to be a way to make sauhaufen money , right ?
so i 've got some degrees , and that 's very good , so that 's what seminar gefunden found in berlin , would you ?
that means . .
you know , how do you go to your company and put your life in your life .
oh no .
really ? ?
now , what do you do if you 've started to do at the beginning of peter in the beginning of 30 , what do you mean by that ?
so , then you get a career as a konsumfetischist , what ?
so what happens to your commitment , what do i know ?
and we also see the an .
so the statistics of geben gave you a perspektive perspective , because 27 percent of them have already been already in a much deeper business than before you have a huge number .
money is always the result of an successful company and a geführten company .
clearly , money is an energy tool for conservation function .
and it 's the basis of all economic . .
but never the goal of a company .
yeah , what is the objective ?

so , if i 've done what i 'm talking about , well , without a goal , there 's no way of right .
and so , goals , though , is always going to be a way to think about , and so on .
and if i did n't have that , so how can i do something i can do , i do n't know what i 'm looking for ?
so this makes me a good feeling .
so as i want to decide , and the risks that i feel like all of this is so und and an .
yes , willkommen welcome to the balance .
but i might have something for you .
a field .
so that 's already , , so it 's almost going on .
successful von from generation to generation .
a für for . .
so what do you do today ?
glaub , i mean , `` slits ? ''
so we 're always immer .
in krisen , and und and nachhaltiger , carbon dioxide .
so , it helps help .
i figure , i can give you one of them .
okay .
yeah , thank you , mr. . .
but there are only questions about this .
that can give you an idea of the importance of making sense of good questions .
can we take that one after the other , i may have a better answer ?
so the first one is , what 's i going to do here ?
yes , da . here 's what 's driving you about you , and the bigger is more than you can .
what are you going to the world ?
what do people do when they work with them ?
what are you ready to give ?
what are your inside , maybe also , you know , `` well , what 's the cure ?
why is this so important to see ?
because these are also your practice .
and how did we learn that ?
and if you want to build a ship , nicht the men together in parts of work , they 're going to collect it to make sentences , but they say , you know , for the flower , you want to be the , .
yeah . good .
so , i 'll study the next questions .
what 's my favorite zielzustand ?
what does that mean ?
yes , jetzt now , you can do your target .
ausmalen in in detail , but i ' you in front of you when you , what you do n't want to do it .
do you really know the story with the pink elephant ?
remember me there .
do n't ?
deworming .
so , watch up .
do n't give a pink spin .
okay ?
does it work ?
so there 's no pink hair .
what caused ?
there 's no pink hair .
you see ?
so here 's what we 're looking at in terms of what we do n't want .
what is the only possible possible ?
so where about this ? ?
yes , sure you do what you want .
so kannikel oder , or maybe the auf on the . .
but look at it .
by the way , what 's the point i just do is , what do you do ?
i got here with you .
let 's look at that .
somebody in in this murdured named president smith .
anyone ?
at the top of three , this was brutally of blunted death to death .
i each of you your your your your at the time that deed place .
i the the glass in the bedroom .
i mean his scones scones below-stairs .
and i 'm like my petunias in in the shed . .
arrest lady smith .
oh did you have the did you , you know ?
as any tell you one one one one one one one one one .
her .
it 's just a of of . .
the real is is observant where 's observant .
and what does it look like ?
did you notice what ?
did something changes ?
okay .
okay .
okay .
so , then we 're going to look at the bear .
and it works .
somebody in in this murdured named president smith .
anyone ?
at the top of three , this was brutally of blunted death to death .
i was each of of to your your your your at the time watching the took .
i the the glass in the bedroom .
i mean his scones scones below-stairs .
and i 'm like my petunias in in the shed . .
arrest lady smith .
and , , how do you do it ?
so i know i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
i 've seen the first time .
i thought it was n't being too .
and much more time , i was thinking about the head , could it be the whole time in the area over the area ?
through my life .
and the reason i understand it is totally meaning .
so , in order to go up , if you 're going to see the memory of our perception and our erstmal report .
but what 's really happening now ?
what ' i was , and what do i do ?
and because of that , you know , you 're able to make your sense of your perception anywhere , you know , there 's another major rural quality .
well , yeah , thank you so we get to the next question .
how could i actually come to my goal ?
so , that 's what i find good questions .
i mean , i mean , every time , every time , i do n't even know .
yeah , da . there 's a great news for you .
that 's going to be easier than you might have known this .
because if you get your sense of your inner , your inner mission , and if you put it down the hard goal , you 've read that it 's going to happen to you .

you 're not going to be able to do anything else to notice things on you .
these are the famous , du in the morning .
and even at least , i do n't know what you 're looking for , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you get more , to get there more .
and you also have a big model .
the haben have this great property .
di bush , , if it was n't going to keep that in its eingeladen meeting in tanzania .
for lunch , the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , politiker , politicians , ethnic engineers , architects and he had a very strong gepflegt .
but not in our today , where it is , is who it sich through ?
who 's right ?
but in fact , suddenly , all of these different types of things , things are , in no way , some of which might have found themselves .
well , the next question is , what 's the next question ?
and you can get successful entrepreneurs in the same way .
instead of planning big and smoke and so on the next step only step on the next step .
because what do you want to do in the area of uncertainty ?
but the lead to this very , very , very und .
and if it 's nothing , dan is looking at hackers else .
and even if the big , ausgemalte zielvorstellung of them was there , then they have other people .
so it 's really important to you as well .
that gives you the inner security .
and in the rest , what do we actually learn all do ?
even though we did n't know that , but no one was told it .
well , you 're going to do bei kids .
so this is something that 's trying to learn , this is looking like this , and this spielerische layer is also , it 's fun that in a company , it 's in a . .
and that 's exactly the gegen versus the uncertainty that always makes us think of .
yeah . thank you .
so it turns out it 's a great thing .
but i do n't know , for me in the company , but i do n't think you need to have a lot of ändern in that moment .
and , in germany , there 's always a general mood .
and i understand , there must be the politicians first worry that it changes .
okay , my boy , come with me .
like going down here in water .
what do you think , how many people can you change ?
ten ?
morton bast
ten million ?
look down there .
who you see ?
precisely .
that 's where you can change that you can really change .
or to look at it , you can see the change that you see in the world in the world .
do you think beautiful words and big work , but how does it do work ?
we still have some auf on our . .
useful in all sorts of leadership , or when you feel too small for something or when you feel a spürst , and you have all that to do .
and if you ask yourself in these situations , what are happy for you now , you 're not going to be able to make sure that you can take yourself to make you feel more powerful .
`` well , you 've got to tell you what you 're trying to do is what you 're doing right now .
and to finish , `` ask you what you actually want to do from this crisis or what bad happened is because .
so i mean , if that 's what you 've done , that 's what happened .
yeah .
wotsu vielen . thank you .
and do you think that 's going to go through my quality ?
yeah .
and it gives you all two things .
first of all , we were running on top of your inner , , which is what 's going to be in your business language .
because that means your perception .
and second , on your own sense , your inner sense of self .
because that 's what makes you like the other people to behave in .
the future is always growing when we change our own perception .
do you want to do this ?
yeah , i guess .
thank you .
all right brenner .
yeah .
so , what do you think of us ?
nice .
do you .
and how are we going to do this now ?
is this a new ? ?
i mean , yes .
clear .
but i mostly see the sehe .
heißt einhauchen einhauchen .
and that 's what the wirklich really is .
it 's a vom of the der of . .
and no , it 's new , , . .
that 's the . .
the only one , in the big famous name , has been . .
from robert über , about werner graf , oder oder , or whatever they are .
let 's just . that spirit .
and who is probably going to know from our der the next friend of our time .
you see , i 'm . .
so perhaps , it would be obvious for me to understand me with kids and their future .
instead , this is the view of the rest of my time .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i were doing the program , and i started für ,
we strafgefangene unternehmerisch , , which means you can either do your entweder , or find yourself after your local weight , and then you can imagine that .
so why do i give me all the , , so those who have failed are the great mistakes ?
our program is not so easy to understand how the programs are doing for children .
and frankly , i thought the der of the last place in the universe is where i would work .
what do you think is the most important success factor in childhood with people who we work ?
we found that there are more positive problems often of male positive technologies .
and if you think about it , why it 's going to happen in certain so , so many und , and there are often a lot of gibt that the father does n't have a surprising work that he is eating drugs , that he 's in the prison .
and if a junge boy about what he wants to do out of his life , he might have no better idea how different life would look because he has no better cause .
and he seinem his father .
i ' to you .
martin is unseres our program .
his father was obese and made all of the family .
when he was 12 , his mother died and he and his little brother had had to home .
it was the der of the great .
he was shy and und and therefore the perfect victims .
and up to the day as his little brother had been so higher , so as much as it had remained on the ground .
there was an first time going on to the first time at the first time , and he went to the enemy and he agreed .
and that day , he was suffering .
and so it was .
violence is the same thing as his father 's life .
now , the same thing i 've just described is i 've just described .
and after the age of childhood , we have a lot of oder and a lot of oder .
they do n't know much different than their resources and their umfelder . .
and then you get one day with people in jail who are just the same thing to the same level that they do n't get better enough .
what do you think , in prison , if you 're in prison ?
usually it 's not much good .
and they 're getting better leaders in the . .
they sell between drugs on a higher level and plan in the middle where they could live after the einbrechen .
and this is then going into germany , prozent percent .
that means , in germany , each french is a second one .
then there are people in the prison who really want to change .
but also , these people have a monopoly on the counter .
and there 's . .
and everywhere where they 're coming is their first identity .
whether you 're looking at a conversation , whether you 're looking at a place for whether or not you 're going to be able to build new private relationships everywhere , you 're going to be able to have this identity , with this konfrontiert that you 're in a society in society .
that 's the problem we are .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what kind of property , you think , do a lot of mit ?
they 're going to be surprised .
these are ongoing skills .
now , if you 've got a aufgebaut factory , it has a lot of von , vertriebswegen and mitarbeiterführung .
the theme of the theme has a little bit of a , , otherwise , in prison .
these are the qualities we want to use for something positive .
we start our program with a local education education in prison , three materials in prison .
we teach the benefits of goals and the economy .
each people , they write , they write their own und , and each one of them will take them into a persönlichkeitstraining .
and then we came back to the bei , in the , , in the absence of their personal relationships and also at a kind of unternehmensgründung .
what is our program going from here ?
it 's a great range of , from the zur to für for . .
we 've got a dabei program .
a very large amount of mass , and that 's what i want to introduce to you .
unternehmerisches leaders and his vom of the fast money have been very early , very early to trade .
he always had fun to do business .
it 's zum for the first time .
and it was n't particularly . .
all right .
he said to her today , he gave his second foot .
so it 's ist .
he just took in a more complicated piece , and then it went on .
and it learned how he can use his local energy for something nutzen .
he 's gone in september 13 , then zweitausenddreizehn got his für for gegründet .
cows go great , he can now live with them .
he was . very well .
and he 's here today .
i 'd like to give you möchte .
let me go back to martin , which i told him at the beginning .
and martin , after its childhood , has been able to take a education education and ended up in the hooligan-szene room .
and there were food and drugs there in the tropics industry .
he was working as und and türsteher .
for 20 years , he 's using this life .
and he tells us that he 's going to have this kind of selbstbewusstsein hat at this life .
one day he had some hard to anyone in a way that he was wurde .
it took me about the teil piece , and the dort has really changed its life .
and he learned how he could make more force more success and more quality without more quality without his source without drugs or without drugs .
and he was so excited about his decision that he 'd decided he 'd like to share .
and he wanted to become part of the werden .
this has work .
so it 's working for a number two years , and our subjects are in their way to the freedom , because he knows that if you want to change it , and if you want to change the right tools with your hand , it 's going to be much more possible than you often want to .
the basis of these successes are by people like they .
and people who are going to go to prison that would come up with each other that we 're going to come up with us to write our participants in their , , in their personal quest .
this is our , , the vorträge talks in our class , these are students who are doing machen der .
and these are our partners that are directly our participants right after in conflict .
and these people take very much from our program .
an example .
we 're making a practice called nennt .
and we then then in the middle of the room , we see a great unsere of our participants on the one , and our ability to the other side .
and i then see different questions .
and every time anyone in the room would tell you that question , it 's the line .
and here 's what we all share in all of us , whether we sit inside the prison .
but also where the differences are .
and an example of that , where the differences are , is a question .
i grew up in a sozialen social dictionary , or i had a dream of something that 's been in 1968 .
there are always many of our subjects involved in the line , and they 're very few of our people .
one of the question i 'd like to do is come up with all of us who all together , the ' i want to ask .
this is what i 'm telling you all the time .
maybe we can get a little light in the audience .
i can see you .
there are all .
wow .
thank you .
now , i 'm going to ask you a question now , and if you ask that question , you 're going to go back , otherwise they 'll be simple .
it 's kind of like our culture we 're moving right now .
i did things in my life physical things for whom i could have predicted , but not .
so if you ask this question , you 've got to go to you .
that 's important to be the car .
it 's important , perhaps low marihuana .
that 's what happens to do with not exactly the nicht .
okay .
and it 's also important , perhaps every career is not always zu .
all right .
most of them are .
we have some im in the room .
that 's wonderful , because i am happy .
thank you , you 're going to sit down .
in this question , if we put the den in the game , we 'll have a very often match in the game .
and a lot of it 's clear how much happiness you might have .
happiness with parents , happiness , with the environment , in which they grew up with the friends , but also happiness that they may not always be there if they were at the edge of the oder or they did it .
what are the results of our work ?
prozent percent of our households find out of within tagen days after their suffering .
that 's a fast fast .
prozent percent has already done .
one third of the subjects in the last year was . .
and our liegt 's seven percent .
i 've been told by seven percent of a in in germany by prozent percent .
i am . .
a kostet cost in pro jahr per year in pro .
and it 's a beautiful , , was , which is a von from seven percent of sechsundvierzig percent for sechsundvierzig percent .
when my father and i started building the gegründet , we were very crazy for quite pretty crazy .
i gave my marketingjob in in a big company .
but i have to tell you , i did n't have a arbeit job in my life .
we encourage our participants to take responsibility .
responsibility , what 's happening in your life , and it 's all responsibility of what 's going to happen in your life .
not too to hide nothing .
because that leads to a whole new position , and it allows you to actually build it again .
and so it 's very happy to me , and so proud of our participants are von by their way .
and i brought you a little video here .
movie .
so i became invited to two years and eight months because of dangerous .
i was verstoß against the zu for three years and 10 months .
i 've been able to get on board .
so , i 've got noise in two years because of dangerous . .
i was wegen körperverletzung and handeltreiben mit with . .
so , by the time i was involved in , my life has changed .
and what was important to me was that , , which is made .
because there was my absolute . .
i was n't , , sorry .
i 've taken goals .
i found a way to look at this again .
and you go to a very different consciousness , and you go out of it .
and so far , it has been more and more and more and more ohne , and then you 're always immer into something .
with the wrong people , and they do n't do that now .
well , the problem is that a lot of no haben is when the outside .
that 's the biggest problem , because it 's going to be clear to get you back into the old .
you do n't know anything else .
and by the way , through this kind of individual , , no matter what it 's going to spend is just my whole way of thinking about myself , over others , talking about what 's going on with the other society that has been completely done for me in the two weeks .
i 've heard of my first woman .
and since , six months of good , i went together with her .
so that means we started a new relationship .
and because i also have the whole und and many other things .
i 've got a lot .
i started with my family in the back of education .
so i 'm working in my classroom , i 'm sorry .
and i 'm just going to go on a zum it-systemkaufmann .
you really have to realize that there are very , very many people in the world , as for example , now , about this period of time and actually being over , i do n't know , engagement engagement that people have support .
i 'm grateful to have them come into the idea that they do so .
i 'm grateful to say you have trouble in trouble , and i 'm extremely grateful that i have to be part of that .
and also , of course , all the people who have support the support .
i used to talk about a lot of people talking about this , and that 's what i 've come up with , which is good , that does .
and that 's why i do .
and i thank you .
come to prison .
each of them has something that we can need .
whether or not they have been trained our participants to their beraten , whether it 's as if they 're in the event of a financial support .
whether they want to carry our program in a new new set of our program .
talk to us .

and let 's look at the conversation with you .
thank you .
and habe , i was at hilfsorganisation für 'nen , nepal entwicklungseinsatz in .
in a time i was doing something serious .
you know , there 's these things .
it turns out to be bewerben .
the gehen go .
it 's a clock in the elevator .
there is a lot of ways to be able to do today .
you can see how you can study umgehen .
anyway , i was also . .
with my work , and this is what i 'm doing .
now , what i really need to talk about today is .
and not of real problems .
my problem was i was und , and i could really figure out exactly how my life would look like in 10 minutes , 30 years ago .
it was . .
and that fand thought i was scary .
to make it informed .
basically , i had a quarterlife crisis website .
wie like . .
i just did n't know if i was going to go to the weg path ?
do i just feel ashamed ?
or what if i could make my nochmal again ?
and look what happens .
then i 'm waiting .
that was like the thought .
i was in this era at a time .
as i said . .
the war was also even in spite of der of the absolute classroom .
you put out all of the world in a very good tree , and you put the country into a very art way .
but also , auch also , very länder countries .
in fact , developing countries where there is a lot more to be able to see , and they would say when they were talking about dörfer villages with pretty einheimischen group , even though they have nothing , much happiness and joy .
and in fact , from these images and lebt , there 's a gewissermaßen situation .
and that was exactly what i was looking for a while for a while .
i was what i was doing .

and also , i found a little von from me to write a country i did n't really know exactly .
and that 's what i wanted to change .
i wanted to give countries properly .
we can write artikel articles .
and to give my personal interest .
how do you teach countries better ?
by seeking people lives .
people are living in the people .
not in the hotel .
by seeking the challenges and the problems of people .
and by using people working .
at least , that was the answer i could give in the question .
and that 's what i wanted .
and i wanted to make something hard .
i wanted to make a dialogue .
something good .
and this sense of me in front of me , in a noch , still try to grow .
i 've had a lot of developing countries in the developing world , but i was just really touched myself .
until herrschte , a bürgerkrieg civil war did n't only have low government , but many economic and social problems left .
with a $ $ income of euro dollars , das is the poorest country in south asia .
and also , one of the 20 poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below poverty .
almost one fifth of the population is suffering .
forty percent of adults ca n't read and write .
all of these facts are connected to a lot of personal stories and experiences that i met on this journey in a time in which i was ready and open for change .
in fact , i wanted to change something .
and for me , after my family came out of my apartment .
i quit my job .
and lastly of aid .
and i 'm also going to give you a demo of the answer that i had on my job .
because she 's just a war .
it 's going to be a serious case of international international powers .
and it was n't to be a für for a weltenbummlerin die that wants to be a mal and a support of her journey .
hello ?
does it go ?
my job was really serious , and good .
at least , i thought .
and the answer was a frechheit . .
i was really . .
and yet , of course , it 's a fairly emotional response .
well , never . .
instead , i 'm very powerful feeling about making something good .
i used it as a motor to make my own company .
deworming .
nick and and travel . .
a company that basically basically exactly what i was looking at .
that 's the possibility of a country differently .
the possibility , a country really started .
by trying to live with people else and work .
and it 's not going to be working anywhere , but it 's not entwicklungsprojekten .
you can catch the way in two words .
so und and . .
that means much , like the place you can do good things .
you can do good .
now this may sound a little bit more . .
it 's not .
ist is a social business business .
we use silk as a tool for sustainable development .
also , we use als as a tool for sustainable development .
so , , cannon and . .
because the people who would travel with us during their very home .
they pay for their journey , like in one else .
but they just travel differently .
they live in . .
and the principle is not much oder , or much more sondern .
social computing .
and . .
it turns out to be our participants , and we 've changed our participants and interests in different projects .
we can do a lot of work in areas that otherwise we could do n't have any chance in the traditional condition .
because simple infrastructure is missing .
the other thing we can build is sustainable projects .
we can enjoy our sustainable projects and prevent ourselves .
so we 're spending to a hundred percent ourselves .
they 're not paying to support .
and this is us for the work of what we 've been doing for our work .
we started with our work in beijing .
jahr years we have our commitment on uganda .
and now after four years of us , i was married and my husband and i have a team with a team a team .
let 's go to the weg path ?
or what if we think about that bigger ?
now , if we even make that back further ?
in fact , if we do n't only have social computing and sustainable travel , then do we mean that in his direct way ?
and that 's what the individual miteinbeziehen industry is ?
or some special individual . .
so basically , it would be a new company .
a company in companies .
in other words , the same philosophy as . .
do we want that ?
the next question was the next question .

certainly we want that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're in a moment .
because we asked the same language .
because we sent the same dream .
because we understand the challenges .
and so , in this year , we have a sister in this year .
deworming .
and with fördern , we add a creative company in our development and in the process of using extraordinary people .
and we 're looking at people , entrepreneurs or employees from creative companies with individual development .
so these are the personal social and weiterentwicklung development of beinhalten .
and then they . the . .
they also have a lot again .
a effort to push the potential of a potential cost a second one .
he shows one in relatively short time where you 're standing or where you 're . .
but where you might have a little vorurteile sandwich .
where you might be a little ist , to think of yourself .
and he 's showing you , which is really good .
it takes one of his strength .
it 's the creativity , suddenly , a great one .
or if it 's the fate that you 've discovered .
the unknown things that you ca n't change .
and the force , things to change that you can change .
and you can change a lot .
in a very short time .
we know that .
one example .
these are rose margeret , and und and . .
they are five very wonderful women from uganda .
i mean , it 's schicksalen .
she wunderschöne beautiful , frozen seit for years .
and for years , nothing happened .
because they did n't have a market .
because they do n't know how they can improve the quality .
because nobody told me what design might be in .
we wanted to help these women .
and in this year , we started a gegründet program .
empowerment product . .
products are taking people from poverty .
they give them an income .
a future will .
we went out with our live live yesterday .
and we 're starting with a empowerment edition . .
a edition von of thousand von of our women .
he 's not only selling them for a year .
but it also allows us to make a lot more bigger .
this first ist is kind of social numbers , and in in one .
so , the ability to support this is to do that for one of you can do for a data , but we can actually travel on the project .
it can travel the women .
in the long time , we do n't want to give five women a job , but a hundred and a half .
and this is not just in uganda , but also in beijing and other , in which we 're working on arbeiten .
now , of course , this is just a project from our zyklus cycle of projects .
we 're working in all central fields .
in the area , education and and health and environment and . .
because the work in only is just too little .
what happens to children when the women work ?
right .
that 's why we started in essex , in uganda , and in uganda , we started two centre neighborhoods .
everything happens in our life .
and the whole thing has more meaning than each one project .
we 've seen what we 've ever found in the different projects .
they 've always had the same opportunity in common work .
and to conclude , i want to take you right now on a journey .
and i 'll tell you the eyes .
come in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting at a esstisch .
and it 's und and . .
you just ate with your zu .
there was . .
deworming .
tasty .
the walls are . .
in fact , it 's warm .
you aus from the window .
and these kids are . . .
their füße foot den the sand .
you put on your . .
they 're a thin oranger staub .
the children are laughing .
and call fun your name .
you 're not dich you ca n't call it .
deworming .
you do n't know how tomorrow it is .
but soon you will get up .
and the , , on the one hand , were called children .
at the end of the street , a great tree .
this is where you 're going to meet them .
in the 1990s , in the shadow of the mountain , you 'll notice the new design of your besprechen .
as soon as you get hands and you 'll talk to them .
and later , the other women come up .
she smile an .
until you . your english .
under the tree .
in free .
it 's amazing , but there 's still the internet .
tomorrow wieder again with your hair .
that 's what you 're looking for .
the exchange is , every time .
it 's also nice to speak to that .
you hear music .
and the von of . .
mom wäscht im im innenhof innenhof .
she ate a local song .
you 're und and happy .
you can make the eyes again .
each of us can meet the zu of some new particles .
or at least for a short time , they 'll be able to get the spread back again .
and here 's what happens .
thank you .
before i start looking , i 'd point out if one of you tonight that you 're here , before you 've got a haus house .
i 'm ' by the light , but maybe someone wants to survive .
here 's a down there .
two .
now i 'm afraid i 'm not , but in any case here , there are two , which is beautiful , we 've been on it .
i was also a building , and it 's the longest mountain in the east of the city .
that 's the building .
together with two other people in the last summer age six months .
and that 's why i left here tonight .
well , some of you might say .
what 's the point ?
there are many .
but i want to explain it short .
oh what , you 're looking at the basics now ?
and your business then started to park , or how ?
there 's only a small sample of questions that were known to us , our friends , our friends , when they have learned that i have part of one of the protection that i was working with , something called namen .
everybody expected that we had in into the range of eingereiht hatten .
and this is where they 've been building , verbreiteten und , verbreiteten .
and to . the quality of these statements .
but who knows , it 's not my kind of . .
and it was n't the protestform der of the government .
what we 're seeing here is a sign of passage in stuttgart .
this is a public space that is very private , and so for many people ca n't say for it , i 'm not saying , but it 's not so used in public hand , and that 's not how to use public spaces .
we 've had a group of vereint in in the desire with bausubstanz und and sinnstiftend , and und and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell another erzählen .
we were a team , and that 's what i 'm going to do now , because it was a very team team .
from the areas of architecture , urban social social and politics -- and stadtforschung , , statistics , design , music , photography , , und and . .
of course , with various social cultural and personal . .
our research und and sich .
and the ability to do that , in various terms , also on various networks .
and creative part of lösungen solutions in the , that we 've done to realize zu .
we 've actually chosen to . the priests .
but it was really about us that we 're going to sit out of stories and ideas .
we 've asked memory and pictures .
and from these memories and images , they 're trying to develop ways to develop the brakes .
it was important to us that the process is happening .
we do n't know what we 're going to do as a u.n. , we 've used to be plattform and . .
this was like a und and besetzen und and turned to a . .
in the words that we 've done , what i 'm going to do is go here tonight .
every city has orte places .
there are a face .
in many cases , this was und and und , and being seen in the origin of citizens as teenagers .
they 're the dead places in the city because they do n't really expect to what we expect in a public space .
so for example , we have haben .
they 're going to do that , but also the public ones , the urban places , it 's often . .
mm , which want to go back to these places , often , often , most of the other things we do .
what has also got to do with me like this is to do a few questions , some of the ones get questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places are not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of our city where our social lives are happening .
so we 're often going to do the first bande of dna to our neighbors if we meet our way to the screen .
and if we can just have an opportunity to sit up , and we 're actually , when the spaces are designed as well .
and we just have längeres on time .
that 's where they form , sometimes .
but what matters is a sense of community .
and the more i can do in this kind of public space , the faster and the more way of the other community .
and if i 'm not , , then the thing that you 'll call is the emergence of a brand .
we then went two challenges .
we can do it in terms of consciousness , responsibility and productivity for their neighborhood , or in the auch .
how can geeks be turned in creating new advances ?
how can in be turned into ideas ?
gegen against congress and caregiving in these bedeutsamen sites and gegen die and also not the eben of the same places .
now , imagine now that you 're sitting here , again , you get the newspaper and read the following text .
love religious and citizens , we 're in charge of us to be able to introduce three possible solutions for the des of vorstellen that we 've created before ,
you can think of the idea of an option .
and the proof of most of the people in the bürgerstimmen are actually . .
would you go ?
would any of you go to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds so awesome .
there 's no way of what 's going on .
you can , the way that looks in the future .
and as i said , a great thing about the first moment .
i 'm trying to talk about an explanation .
and that 's because i think that 's not really what i think you ca n't really choose or whether or whether or it 's or social .
first of all , traditional häufig are often too late .
that means that you do n't have any opportunity to make your own ideas to solve or fundamental alternative , but it 's actually known design , and you can also decide whether they 're oder or in in the urban city .
or , as a friend of fact , that color gave you for example .
the second explanation of classic geht is mainly about information and accountability .
think about the three varianten style .
what we 've got here is , we want to show you , and it 's got to vote .
frustration and sind are often the effects of what i find kind of finde .
i do n't want any decision about oder or treffen , if i 'd actually have bmx strecke instead of blumenbeet gehabt .
but it 's also different .
but even though the der of the world 's population , we have a lot of erfahren experience .
and so we made experiences and i want to share with other teilen .
i 'd like to share it to other , , other projects , but also , of the city and the politics .
because those are the ones that are actually going to do these things , and are actually responsible for these things .
now , if it 's really interested in terms of what it 's so often und , and then we need to get it , and then we need to have new . .
so at the end of the day , i was all that you 're all right now .
and that 's why i think very important to it .
it 's important that they 're all going to go , and i want to give you with our example of being a chance of a chance .
and i teach them all , because they 're the ones who can give up a new einfordern .
so what we need to do is look forward to the citizens in terms of the citizens , responsibility of , responsibility and commitment to their states and how do you think of und and zu ?
first of all , they give you on a ride .
in treffen , auf , citizens are made of und and different interests .
what we 're seeing here is a particle model that we asked .
what we see here are some und and im in conversation .
the goal has to be that all of these conversations in a screen , so they do n't have the interessen interests or the kompetenzen of the skills of citizens .
the citizens are experts , they 're experts for their neighborhood , they know what they 're missing , which is a place in which tradition a place is a place , and also what they 're missing to you .
the , , especially at the city can be able to do what 's going on to the project in the project .
in prison or in a particular case , other einbezogen can be created the stories that are in the project .
that all leads to a , , where all information for everyone is available and then can get to the place .
and then , by that , you can also be able to be able to be able to keep a copy of the site .
it also means that the desire of the favelas are actually serious .
and also , when somebody says , i want to give you a neben about this .
now , of course , this is true of the science , but the goal has to be , in any sense of all the things that you see , what is the right solution , and perhaps in the dann , and it may be in a different place .
as i said , it has to come out of this .
the second point is a variety of . .
our ist is . .
in a sense , if it comes to großen great group and talk .
another one can write good , but the text would not have to speak to the text .
some of them might be a little bit or . .
or build its ideas in mindmap auf .
so what i 'm going to do is to give up a different kind of task in order to be able to do different kinds of
so for example , we 've got the opportunity for instance , and we can get to be there before what happens .
in the background , small shows .
we 've had the opportunity to give us zu .
we 've had the capacity to paint .
we 've had the capacity to write up .
regardless of age .
this was a mädchen girl .
we had the opportunity to connect our ideas to ideen ideas .
also , the way to deal outside of zeitunabhängig is to be given .
so , for example , this could happen to you about a passieren , which is able to happen about aids passieren .
and the und and dramatic forces of the outcomes are actually den by people .
we even have this whole process going on facebook , and on one of them and at one of them and at the same time and at the same time .
our third point . .
you may remember , i told you that oft often too late .
in my veranstaltung event , it was already three planungen .
ist is the process , but it 's only when it comes straight , and if you do n't even know what 's going to happen to you .
and when it comes through , i 'm going to get back to the point in the moment , wird , which will give you a place in the area .
gehört belongs to be a selbst self .
and then , if it 's not at the beginning of ist , the veranstaltung of all that is going to look and so forth by the experience of the previous aufbaut .
what 's happening is when citizens stadt their city and their city .
it 's already in a lot of projects .
i 've got an example here in , , which is , , probably in many of here .
in new york , a project came out there 's a . .
in crowdfunding-kampagne sind , over six weeks of dollars , they 've got the funding to make it possible or at least . .
at the time , politics could not be different to make the idea of their own .
also the in in new york , which i do n't have to say , because it 's got to be one of the most important der in the city was not an idea of politics or government .
in the opposite , the für for standen have been found .
so in , , we 've gone back in germany , citizens already have pläne plans for a place .
the city had said to be ist .
the four weeks , that we have for military species , which is less than aus .
today 's the der of the city rouge .
as the page goes down , the city is wonderful , and the city has the , , which is the u.n. that came out there and other unterstützt .
in addition to that , you know , your own auf citizens .
in denmark , a fußgängerbrücke . .
all right . you want to say that .
now we 're just going to go now .
but i think it 's wrong for me to leave the city .
why ?
one , because they 've got a look at it .
as it turns out , it might be citizens in terms of citizens , or businesses in some form matter , the city has a responsibility for projects that are also on the edge of attention .
and for others , if the city has its projects , there are other .
it can only be a kann economy .
even our goal , by the way , was a constant initiative that gave him after a half of the year of working the outcomes and the responsibility of the city .
we 've had a hat effect in the january .
it 's still running there .
that 's why , unfortunately , we have the problem right now that we do n't have the responsibility yet .
but we know , in any case , when the city is successful zurückkauft , if the odds are actually successful , that it 's going to be an stattfinden .
but in which form of space , it 's also open .
so to finish , i 'm convinced that a lot of projects can be in terms of their meaning , complexity or their cost of the city must be a chance to create happiness and zu .
and if you get only time and you get to the citizens .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each other , you 'll see that you 're sitting here tonight .
if we demand our business and at the same time , we do n't see how much than a wahrnehmen , but as a . .
that 's it .
yesterday , after the waren day , we were here in im und , and we came into the gekommen .
we talked about gesprochen .
so this idea of trying to have a second chance to have a second chance in this life when it has n't been done in this life , it 's going to have a second chance .
we found so interesting .
and we were relatively quickly telling us that there are two things we did n't have to experience .
one is in accident .
the second thing was immediately am in the table at the table .
no .
no .
school , some of you may remember raus klassenarbeit .
i mean , it 's like this . now it 's jahre years , but the words are bei me immediately .
my professional sich , and i just want to leave it back .
and i do n't know what it was like to you , but when i was in my career , it was always taken by the ernst seriously who was always looking at me .
i do n't know what 's going on in the situation .
they 're going to understand it , so my school was n't quite beautiful , and after i had my last hinter behind me was completely clear to school .
and what i 'm going to say is , if i put some of the most beautiful days i 've spent there , i spent in schools .
it 's a lot of fun and a total failure .
so how did it came ?
how could this happen ?
it just started with something happened , which i could n't love .
i got children .
so my wife got the kids .
and that 's because it 's clear that it 's the key to make these zu .
until that day , when she said , `` honey it 's . .
and here 's where you go .
yes , . .
that 's where i opened the door and then i sat there in this und and i felt in in the . .
and this looked like this .
and it also goes like in a way to school , and i swear to myself , and i do n't have any of the time to do that .
and when i left the teacher , and you know , the kids do n't learn for school , but for all of life , i 'm like , oh , my god , the sentence i did n't have . me .
what is it that we really did out of school in the school in school , actually ?
so many of us have dort there really well .
where did they have in their life in their life , what do they need to do in their life ?
and maybe some people know what the capital of terror means .
now , what else ?
or , , this ability to make a lot more of knowledge in terms of time , just so that i can then make it on a wieder , until i 'm bad ?
good , i 've been doing it for the , , but otherwise ?
and what does a von face of a subject is someone who 's a good doctor ?
is it possible , is it possible for the good hadron properties ?
no .
so , no , for life , not for school .
if we look like this , about jahre years , in the middle of the jahrhunderts century , that 's what we have ended up .
this is the time in germany , in germany , in germany .
and where it was , where it has been , its roots has its roots .
and if we think of time at that time , it was actually , in fact , people had no access to know of their time .
and there were those four or six years that they 've been forced to go into school and know with knowledge that were really the only way that had had the knowledge and the facts and the information of their time .
today , a mehr more information in its pocket than the largest library of the time .
and in the middle of the jahrhunderts century , that was the time of frustration .
that means there 's some changes in the world , and there are people need to get these new machines .
but at the same time , people have to have to have these machines and fix these machines .
and we needed people to bring these machines and put them into these factories .
maybe they do it .
the schulsystem camp that we have in germany in germany has its root in this time .
and there might be something like that .
again , because it was probably so much , that what i learned in school is the work for work at the bottom line , who was at the bottom line , which was there for his life .
let 's make a break look at the future .
let 's go to the jahrhundert century , where it is , and let 's look at that year .
the year that year was there was the first gerade ever ever before before .
i was ready with my studies , and i thought now is the time now , now you 're going to do this , the first company .
yeah , after some of us , about the internet , and then i say , `` well , i 'm going to have this now .
and some businesses have been around us , and we 've been getting bigger and bigger and bigger , and we 've gotten so nice slowly , and some of the companies they have is in the lower case .
you can see two times in life .
and we had a couple of years ago .
so we came up with a nice growth , and we had an extraordinary conversation on the board like , , community-manager app-entwickler .
i do n't know if you have konkrete vision what these people are doing , but what i did when i was in school , we did n't have any idea of what ever would have .
even when i made it up from something like the internet did n't speak .
and the kids we are going to send in school are to send our job in 10 , 15 , five or 30 years years ?
the only honest answer is what we have no idea .
and what do you know , what will be the facts you need to be successful in this future ?
and if you 're honest , the only answer is , we have no idea .
and because we have come here to the future , i could give you the future of who i could give you the für .
you have jackpot , . i read .
well , look , you have no idea .
how do we get out what to learn to us ?
what are the things we need to make children living in life ?
and maybe it 's a way of looking at what businesses is looking at today .
that 's the number of school , yes ?
the aus from schools and universities come into companies .
and if you look at random anschaut , then you have the first one , you know , like the . .
so , the idea is , so the reading is going to do so , we 're looking for military hochschulabsolventen mit , with 10 years , and about 12 years old .
now , you can do this in the future .
but what school might mean is the things that will always be important , these are the ones that soft skills , and i 'm sure that these skills die will be the basic der in the future .
and it 's in the principle of three groups .
this is to be one , businesses wants to die that are linked to them , so that 's what they serve is .
and then you want to think about all the businesses in the business .
and then they want these companies who are sind .
so we have cognitive leaders thinking and . .
let 's start with mortgages .
that 's relatively fast .
if we look at how economies works today , how fast it is , how quickly changes it .
, , the whole thing is going to be . from the internet of the internet .
i do n't need to share for you guys who can study the change .
i mean , there must be a staff .
i mean , there must be a staff .
this is quite exactly the opposite of what was needed in the factory end of the jahrhunderts century .
the second issue is the problem .
there 's responsibility .
there 's people who take responsibility .
first of all , and your own life .
but also for the big whole .
whether it 's the company or even as a society , we want to be able to help the responsibility for the big whole .
and the third thing that 's going to do is that it 's almost at the time .
and if we remember the wm , then there was this beautiful statement .
hollywood has messi messi reagan , and germany has a team .
it was n't broken , who won the gewonnen .
and they could do that in common .
and as anybody who 's been so , this great minority of our time , steve jobs , yes , . .
it was n't the idea that was invented the iphone , who did n't invented the erfunden , who did n't invent it , did n't invent it .
he had a team that made it possible , because only as a team , they could make what they 've done .
so high school , who could get these three things that are at the time that we learn live in .
but there is also some other fourth , and it 's almost more important to me .
and that 's what is learning itself .
if the only thing we can say about the future of security is that it 's grateful , it 's the ability to learn and to learn new and fun that learning of understanding of the time that we live in the future , and that our children in the future are successful life .
now , the only thing to do this is to school .
but where was i ?
i was sitting in this und , and those of you who have kids , who know that this is n't what you have to pay for .
so , as a result , funny after all , it 's still not from any .
so at the time , where gewählt is being asked , then all of a sudden .
yes , i sat there , and what i 'm going to do is to say , at the end of one of my children , these were the teile parts of the event .
less fun , it was as a dad when i was a kid in order to und the subject and learn the entire program .
and less fun , if the child is sick , because in school 's school , it 's hard .
and finally , this oder , or was a member of these an to this school , again , like elternabend . .
in fact , it was n't a , , it was kind of like a , , so right after the last decade and in reality , we were also the only parents who were invited to .
and i ' them now , and also the details of this time was clear , and we have to push our child there .
now , sind are two years where we 've been .
what are we doing wrong ?
and we were actually the question asked to our child .
and are we the only ones that go to this ?
now , i was in the last two years since i was talking about this , and i 've talked to you about a lot of people i 've been talking about , you know , not alone .
there 's a lot of them out there , and this was two years ago , and there was two years ago , and there was only a new company that we were working with , where the journey go to us , and at night we sat on the table , and we sat across private things .
and what i 'm going to say is , he 's almost the same story with one of his kids , he 's almost the same as we did , and we had this happiness that we could put our children out of school , yes ?
in berlin , there is a riesenauswahl an of different schools , and we could even consider schools .
but can this be there ?
somehow it was too much to get our kids to care and to get these da out there , as they are .
and after we both have the meaning , we did n't change in school since we were n't so much changed , it 's good , we are the first to have the right now .
only , how are we going to change something like that ?
the good thing is that we have haben .
we are not alone .
but we 've seen relatively quickly a lot of amazing people doing great people doing the same thing that we wanted to do , which is to school that 's going to work all the time .
it 's not that only the children and their parents under suffering are what happens out there .
if we look at teachers , 30 percent of teachers have . .
if we look at how the number of people in the last 10 years has changed the last 10 years .
now can it be that all parents doing what wrong do ?
that all children are raised , and that is the teachers they have broken ?
or it can be , you know , we have a school system that just does n't look like this , like this vor , jahren years ago , which is just the same as well .
and we found a lot of people who did this , and we even found people who do n't have children .
and they understood that they need to take responsibility for the future they need to take responsibility to the future by what we do for our children and the kids that go to school in the school .
and we 've come to zweiten second , where there are all kinds of great , that want to change school , and there 's schulen schools , and there 's schulen schools , there 's schulen schools , and there are some great und and there are almost on to any school teachers who actually want to change something .
and even there is one or other other speakers that are then going to be the first step .
and how should we help an helfen ?
we did n't have a concept that we could do it right now .
but we can do what we can do , we can go into these schools and we can , these schools , so the parents , the teachers and the students , and we can do that in two days .
so there are people who worked in the past as well , and learn in two days to work with each other .
they are coming with ganz very concrete challenge to solve them .
and after two times a few days , then , for example , they have developed a new entwickelt or they could give the competition entirely new places like us in a remote school .
or , you know , they have maßnahmen issues for probleme problems that they have in school .
within two days , you can be able to be detected by the next day .
but what is most effect , what happens to these two days , and that makes it so beautiful , so that it 's so nice to me that it 's so nice to me , then also to spend schools in schools , is that energy , which gives me three things .
and when the three things together together , what kind of dumb . .
so business thinking , when you start a team .
and that 's like a model , the . .
and if we were to go four weeks to this , then to school , we start to realize that school began as a whole , to change that there 's completely new culture .
and this is incredibly hot .
and i ' . they asked me to think about school .
i 'll invite you to think about school .
and i ' them too , you know , to talk about school .
talk about what you 're trying to do but talk about what you do n't like .
they 're going to be surprised how much they can do , and how many people do the same thing , but they just do n't .
let us bring them every single school in germany in germany .
let 's change the whole system system .
and let 's put that together with people at school day , with the parents , the teacher and the students .
because we can do that in common .
thank you .
