as an steve act , the los angeles times , one day by the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful
she came from a man who was lying , rau , obdachlos , der , who had been put on a spielte , which had only had two hatte .
many of you are going to know the story , because from artikel 's article has been a book , a book that would come back in verfilmt , with robert als , as steve und , kontrabassisten , , the , , who was at the studierte project , and at the very least of career , early early early early early by its schizophrenie heart .
verließ juilliard , a und , and 30 years later , he lived in the streets of row row in the center of los angeles .
i assure you all to read my book , or to read the film so that you do n't just understand the wonderful instruments that was being created between these two men , but also how the music used to make these connection , and how it was that the instrument was , if the erlaubt allows it to get , to get rid of the street .
i met professor im in 2008 , before two years ago , in the burning disney hall in the u.k .
he just heard about erster first and mary gehört and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking in a very und , ton über , and arthur clinton and about how the dogs could never create in the early world to the early world .
and we went to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , in the state , who was being interested in love with me .
i do n't even have to mention that eine was a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with und and with und and behandelt and behandelt , which is a , , which has been influenced to him .
now as a result of this , he 's right now für for these phasen , which is sometimes this is so bad , and he verschwindet days in the streets of row row of the streets of row to the streets of his own mind .
and in fact , in the same way that was , , when we started working with our first in in the democratic republic of concert in the midwest , that was a clear bee in his eyes , and it was completely lost .
he talked about invisible and smoke and about how he wanted somebody in his sleep .
i was afraid , not pollution , but i was afraid that i could lose it that he could lose one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the wild , when i started out about und and und and other exciting forms of geigenpädagogik zu .
so i just started to play .
i was playing the first sentence by violinkonzert . .
and while i was playing , it occurred to me that in augen , a whole change was in front of it .
it was as though it was under a invisible medicine , a chemical reaction whose mein was my game .
manischer zorn groups turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and documents .
and like a miracle , he took his jewelry and started to go to some von from zu and asked me to play it : , , sibelius , . .
and so we started talking about music , and we started talking about patients , bruckner , und , and all the other , from bis to salonen . .
and i realized that he had n't just had a wissen view of music , but it was a very strange relationship with her .
he was talking about her with a passion and a understanding that i could only know of my colleagues in the atmospheres of los angeles .
by er music and talked about music , out of this , , mann man who was at the streets of los angeles , a , gebildeter , ausgezeichneter ausgezeichneter , in in , in geworden .
music is medicine .
for liberals means music gesundheit health .
because the music allows him to take his thoughts and mit and creativity in something real .
and he er his zuständen .
i understood that exactly is the nature of art .
so that 's why we do music , because we do something that 's deep in the inside of us , our feelings , through our resilience , through our creativity to make reality .
and reality of this kind of expression gets us all , moving , inspired and uns .
and then , , he took him back to the music in a community of friends .
and the kraft force of music took him back into a family of musicians who understood him who understood his talent and . him .
and what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to do it again and musizieren music , whether whether it 's der concert in oder oder or in row row , because it reminds me why i 've become musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .

robert gupta : i want to play a bit of a , i have den the gestohlen .
i hope you enjoy me .
so in my life , a lot of fish believed .
i just loved two .
that first one , that was more like a affäre . .
it was a beautiful fish , gute , good , , ein , a auf on the stream .
what a fish .
even better , he was . into the höchsten of the highest activity of sustainability .
so you could feel it might feel to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty in a couple of months .
one day called the head of the company and asked if i could give in a event , about the sustainability of the city .
of course , i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this extraordinary problem was going to be for our well-being . how are we going to do in a fish ?
in the last 50 years , we 've gone up the oceans like we 've got forests .
it 's hard to . the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love to love the , , the , , the , , the , , these are closed .
it 's almost nothing else .
so maybe , you might be , you know , or you 'll be , you know , ein , a part of our future .
many of the things that do n't allow people of the world , the environment , most of them anyway , and they are mountains , let 's say , `` the rains . ''
he has a von of 15 .
that means , 15 pounds of sind are needed to get a smaller bekommt .
not very sustainable .
it also turns very well .
so there was a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted them to hug .
at the day of the event , i called the queen of für for the company .
we call him . .
`` upwake , '' i said , `` only to have the facts right , you 're famous for , you 're so far in the sea that you do n't get the environment . ''
`` that 's true , '' he said , `` we are so far out that the hierarchy of our fish will take away from our fish . ''
and then he er , `` we are basically a personal world .
this von from zu to one . '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
zu .
`` dig to one of what ? what are you doing ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said .
and that evening i was in bed and i thought , what is the hell in hell ?
so i called the next day , briefly before the event , an .
and i said , `` honestly , what 's a sustainable proteins ? ''
he said he does n't know . he 's going to get a break .
well , i mit with a few people in the company . no one could give me an artistic answer , until i ended up with the dirty hulk .
let 's call it clear .
`` yeah , '' i said , `` what for example is sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some , and then he said , `` . . ''
i said , `` huh ? ''
he said , `` yes , blogs , skin , toilet , und and . . ''
i said , `` well , how much of all , it 's chicken ? ''
in terms of perhaps two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
and i said , `` well , what 's math about fish ? ''
there was a long read in line , and he said , `` there are simply too much chicken on the world . ''
i mich from this fish .
no , not because i 'm a genießer und and bin .
this is me .
no , i 've actually been , tatsächlich of this fish , because i 'm standing at god who has a fish after chicken hat .
this second fish , which is another kind of . .
it 's the kind of romantic way that you , you know , the better you know the fish you know the fish .
i ate it in a restaurant in gegessen .
a journalistin journalist had been talking about this fish .
it has a bit to us .
he came on the table with a , , almost weißen white color .
the chef had . him .
keep twice .
obviously , he was still sick .
who can put a fish so well , after he got wurde ?
i ca n't , but that guy can .
let 's call him mr . it 's called a mess .
and no , he does n't eat the fish , and he 's not a fan . at least the way you and i are in .
he 's an icon at la c . .
this is a in in the ecke corner . .
it 's close to the des of the river .
until the 1980s was in the hands in the hands of . .
they prioritize auf on what they were doing .
they made it by using the country .
they built these complicated principles of , , and they wasser water from the country and out into the river .
now , they could n't make sure that this was working , not effective .
and of course , it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of birds , which are many birds .
and this is how happened to be a spanish company with all of the country bought the country .
what do they do ?
you have the river of the water .
you 've literally . the umgelegt .
instead , instead of the water , they used the service to . the water .
they die the gun .
they created an ancient fischaufzucht -- -- , , garnele , aal , -- -- and the company has completely . the green destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen this .
they 're directly out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and anything you see are kanäle animation and these , , and green .
i was n't a very long time in there .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles , and one of the one `` a zum . ''
okay ? so here we were , and we gave us through the library and i was und and , , bis to my neck , and t to be a . .
this is where he gets a certain hervor .
now , he said , `` well , '' he said von .
and here , here he is , sort of , like , a pattern of , , which he think of the giraffe bee .
it turns out that cheese is the biggest part of his career in the nationalpark museum in africa .
i asked him how he became like a geworden .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know anything about fish .
i 'm an expert for relationships . ''
and then he goes and moved into a lot of von from certain birds and algae and wasserpflanzen .
now , do n't get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the gemeinschaft community , in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was über by this stück piece of wood that i had on the hatte .
so i came up with him . i said , `` solomon , how come it is that your body is so ? ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , oh , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , i know you know , i know , you know , you know , i know that the algae ,
but what about their fish ?
how is the ? ? ''
now , he goes down to tell me that it 's such an effective system , that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the adult brain , the , , the , , which is what the fish are doing .
so the system is so healthy , it 's completely . .
there is no food food .
the fact is , you know , is that they do n't know ?
and later on the day , i was looking at this scene with herum , and i asked him , i said , `` for a place that seems to be like natural , '' unlike every farm that i was ever had , `` how do you do it ? ''
in the moment , it was like a einen hätte in the moment .
and we started to get around the corner , and we were introduced to the most amazing picture , thousands and thousands of rain , a very successful logic so far the eye .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at their an , pink .
they . . ''
slits ? i was totally confused .
i said , `` solomon , do n't you sie your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and an in the birds .
now , last year , on this site of 600 birds , more than 250 different species .
it 's the largest and one of the most important private in in all europe .
i said , `` solomon , is a good vogelbestand nicht is not the last ones you want to have on the haben ? ''
he tasted his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building an , intensiv .
this is a complete network .
they eat the . .
they eat the payoffs .
so basically , the head of the room will make the system . ''
okay , so let 's think about this . a farm that does n't take her animals , and a farm that is changing its success at the heart of your fingers .
a , , but also a . .
oh , and the record should not even be there .
they put it in a town of kilometer miles , where the besser is better for . .
every morning , they fly 8,000 miles to the farm .
and each night , they fly 3,000 miles back .
they 're doing this because they can follow the weißen white line of the local folgen .
seriously .
i was able to find some kind of journey of penguins , so i looked forward .
i was like , `` kim , fly 5,000 miles off the farm and fly you to kilometer and sie the night ?
do you make that children ? ''
he looked at me like i was just a song from wire zitiert .
he said , `` no . you make it because food is better . ''
i have n't met the skin of my loved fish who was sick , and i do n't like . . i do n't like it . i do n't like it .
it 's that , , geschmack device .
i never never heard of it .
and yet , when i put it in this restaurant in probiert , it did n't even have a geschmeckt . .
she liked beautiful and in her , as if you could take a walk out of the ocean .
and i mentioned this firsthand , and he . .
he said , `` the skin looks like a seat .
she 's the last , , before something in the body .
she has developed the evolution of evolution in the back of evolution . ''
and then he er , `` but our water did n't have a . . ''
okay . a farm , they do n't . their fish , but a farm that is based on success by success .
and then i realized that if he says a farm that does n't have hat , it would have been huge , because the water durch through this farm train from the river herein .
it 's a river that makes all the things that are moving by that trees are now tend to lead and lead to , chemical , , von of . .
and if it 's called the system , and this leaves is the water as it is ist .
so the system is so healthy , it increases water .
so it 's not just a farm that does n't , its animals , not just a farm that 's , their success at the health of your misst , but a farm that 's literally a ist , and not just for that fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water , , it es in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'm taking him , and they should also be doing it because these , , like auch also , is also . .
you might say it 's a recipe for the future of the future , whether we 're talking of oder or sprechen .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , of one that actually . good .
but for many people , it 's a little bit radical .
we 're not , . we are . . we are 30 .
we love . . we love little . . we talk about local food . we eat what we eat .
and if you say that it 's the things that the future of the world 's future , somebody else in and say , `` hey people , i love the pink commandments , but how do you feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ?
can i be honest ?
i do n't like that question .
no , not because we have enough calories to produce the world more than just .
a billion people are displaced today .
a billion -- that 's more than ever -- because ungleichheiten in in the distribution , not the . .
now , i do n't like this question because it 's certainly the logic of what 's going on for the last 50 years .
getreide d at , , an , an , chemicals in the earth , chicken at fish , and all the time have simply asked : `` if we eat more people , how terrible can that be ? ''
this was the . . it was the poetry . it was the business of american agriculture .
we should call it , what she is , a in in , , which is fast enough capital that makes these production .
that 's not a , , and it 's not agriculture .
our ist today is lower , not because zufuhr , , but because ressourcen resources .
not by the latest und and , , but by constant land , not by body , but through fresh water , not by , , but through forests and , , but through fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that provide every community to feed themselves ?
and to do that , they do n't look at the für for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are at und , and it 's never really good for food .
let 's take the biggest model .
this is the one that auf two billion years ago .
look at an .
companies that are not going to have more worlds , companies that are anstatt instead of , , businesses that are growing up instead of only long , farmers that are n't just caring , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also sind .
and if i 'm really honest , you 're a better fan than i will be .
you know , this is right , because if it 's the future of the good food , it 's going to be
thank you .
now , if i want to give you a thing today , it 's that the study of data that we consume , we 're bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking to think about how we can use information that we can use information , that we can use that pattern , and that we can see changes that otherwise might not have been visible .
so what we 're seeing here is a typical nach for age old .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called und and what i can do with what i 'm going to do with machen , that i can paint after a particular kind of filtern .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes up .
and it 's because in the hier , people are aktivsten , and they 're here in the sind .
so we can take a step further and put out the data , and see that there are und and cancer cancer , not for everyone .
now , if we 're going to go further and we do n't see 40 years , we 'll tell you 40 years , and we 're going to see that obesity is even the most cause of people to worry about .
and who sieht that this is true of men .
so you can notice that this is looking at information and data in this way , in the way , in the way , in the way of a living erinnert .
and if we can do that for bees , why do n't we make sense of content ?
what we have here are now the jeder of each individual '' that has ever been built .
it 's all here . it 's all online .
they 'd like to test this for my talk in their testen .
they can turn into a decade .
you can go back into a particular year .
you can jump directly into certain springen .
now , if i look at it here , i see the promise that appear in those music and the arts .
i 'm a biologist of english tradition , so i 'm going to go over and i can tell you all the time in which strangers are being told .
now , if i want to get a überblick camera , i could say , ok , what if i 'm looking at it all with the theme of this matter ? ''
so i go back and die the perspective .
now i see lemond . .
and so you get an idea of that if you go to this kind of information , breiter , reinzoomen , dann , you do n't just see or do n't just do it .
you make something that 's a little bit different .
it 's something between and we think it 's changing the way information can be used .
so i want to share this idea a little bit further with something which is a little bit crazy .
what we 've done here is , we 've got each individual genommen , and they 've got it on a small run .
the agreement contains a quick ball and a symbol for the area of it .
i 'm just going to show the top 500 half of the wikipediaseiten .
but even in this ansicht process , we can do a lot of things .
and immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are sind in wikipedia .
i 'm going to choose the issue today .
now , after i 've been talking about this , i 've told you that the , that the most of these are used to the time `` `` people of the year . ''
this is really important because this is a familiar , it 's not in one individual steckt .
it 's only because you walk down a step and look at it .
so based on a certain of these kann , i can actually go back to the theme of a year `` `` people of the year '' and all the time .
now , if i know all these people i know that the majority of them are sind : some of them are from science . some are less , coming out of the economy . here 's my boss . and one is from the . .
and interestingly , a ted is also a ted prize .
so we can jump down and look up and look at every ted prize .
you can see , we 're im on the web as if it 's a net web , not just to the end , but much more sophisticated .
and so i want to show you what a small surprise might be .
i 'm just going to show you only the new york times a times .
, , this application -- i do n't want to call it a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can look at it and we can get these zu every single website like this .
so , i can go back one step , and i can jump directly to a certain springen trip .
so this is really important , because you 're just looking at this kind of activity in this way , and it 's a way of looking at it in the same way .
so , in my view , it 's in a particular period of research .
so here is the state of the whole gesture i 've taken up to this .
and i can see anything that i 've seen today , again , again .
and , if i look at a step and look at all of everything , i 'm going to put my focus on this new , and i 'm going to put it up to my . , and here , i looked for ' , here for , , or here to live in life .
and from this one i can put into the page and . them .
it 's an metaphor that 's being used again , and each times it makes the extraordinary greater than the sum of the . .
in the moment , in the world , we think that data is sind .
we 're talking about the eradication of . .
we 're talking about `` floating in information . ''
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that we can go instead of one to another , starting from many things to be able to do many things , and that patterns can see which mistakes would have been left ?
if we can do that , then this time is going to be a new source of
and , rather than just move in information , we can know that .
and if we know how to know , maybe we can actually pull out to it .
that 's what i hear . thank you .
i grew up with a portion science science .
in my school school , i went to school , every day , an hour per . .
and my nose was always made into a book , a , , which is my thoughts in other worlds , and in a way , made up my deep style of my deep , collective curiosity .
and it also turns out that when i was n't in school , when i was in high school through the forests , and they went out and they went out , and they came out and und and und and , and , and , and , all the way home ,
i was absolutely , , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and . the boundaries of the possible .
and my love to science fiction schien in my neighborhood , because at that point , in the late '60s , we started to go back to the moon and die the depth .
alisa kam into our living room with his fascinating exhibition that showed us animals and places and a world of wonder we could never have imagined .
this might be good at the gepasst . .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because of this , it 's not a video game , and there was still the whole record of the earth , i had to create the pictures in my head .
we all had to do this at all . if we read a little bit as kids , we took the description of the und and we put it into the screen in our minds .
my response to this was the drawing and paint of aliens , pure worlds , robots and all that stuff .
in the meantime , i was always used by the teachers , as i was in lehrbuch ,
the creativity had to be somehow .
and something interesting happened . what was really interesting to me , what i 'm really excited about is cousteaus sendungen shows the idea of the world on our planet .
certainly , i would never be able to do a welt world in front of you , and that seemed quite surprising .
but here was one of the world i actually could actually go into , here on earth , and she was just amazing and more sophisticated like all that i would always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided , `` i was 15 .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
but i was n't . by that .
i meinen my father until he finally finally a in buffalo in , , new york , and it made me in the other side of the sea where we lived .
i made my in in a der in the middle of the winter in , , new york .
but the ocean , the real ocean , got only two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years today , i spent about three stunden hours of water , i spent 500 hours of them .
and i learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the ozeanen ocean , is so rich to life 's life , how we can really imagine ourselves .
the evidence of nature does not know in terms of our own , menschlichen human imagination .
until today , i 'm going to think of ehrfurcht qualities for what i see on my sehe .
and my love to the ocean , i love , with the same kind of sound like und and the fact .
when i was growing up as an adult , i was a aussuchte .
this really seemed the best opportunity to drive my inner stories with my need to create images .
when i was a kid , i was constantly und and so .
so , films came from the way of images and stories . that 's what happened .
of course , the stories i 'm , on , out of : , `` '' '' and `` '' . ''
in `` '' , '' i was able to do my für for the und , and i could link it to the verbinden .
so , my two . .
there 's something interesting about `` '' '' : to solve a problem problem in this film -- and that we had to create such a kind of a wasserwesen erschaffen , and we put on german animation , zurück , back .
what came out was the first soft-surface-figur , that was ever in a movie .
the film got no money , which is why he was playing his ein , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the whole world was kind of like vom in the way of magic .
according to arthur finance 's law is fortgeschrittliche technology , nicht technology .
so they saw something magic .
and that 's what i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's not going to be werden . ''
so we went in and say , `` la 2 , '' my next film , is a lot further .
together with erschufen , we created the guy who 's metall , and success is all about how this effect was going up .
and it worked . again , we created something fascinating . and the effect in the audience was the same . we 've got a little more money with film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world has been moved to a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company , together with my good friend winston , , who was at the time of the best und and war .
the evidence of this company was the analoger process of druckern processes , and to begin to stand down and start with digital zu .
and so that 's what we did , and we put it into a kind of time .
but in the '90s , we realized that we were in the und and - -- what we did was we actually started to slow down the company .
i was written this piece , and i wrote that this piece was going to come up into things in things that are going to do things in things and effekte effects in all of new ways , with deep human characters that had been made by hergestellt , and the world should have to be the world .
but the pyramid turned very well . and the people in my company told me that we do n't have to be able to do that at any time that we can do that .
so i moved this , and i made that other film about the big box , which is moving down .
the habe , i sold this as `` und and auf on a ship ship . it was a epischen ausmaßes , , a passionate movie .
but also , i was trying to really describe the real der of the titanic .
that 's why i did the film .
that 's the truth . the studio did n't know .
now , i convinced you , by the way , that 's what i said , `` we 're moving to the . . we started the real . .
we 're going to show it in the des of the movie .
that 's completely important . it 's a great fürs for marketing . ''
and i urge you to avoid a zu .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to me that your own imagination can make a difference .
and we actually created six months later a reality where i put myself in the russian wiederfand , four kilometers underneath the surface of the north , and i was able to show the real article through a anschaute .
this was not a movie , no , , that was real .
so , that really blew me .
and they had a lot of difficulty . we had to build cameras and und and everything else .
and i ended up , and i came up with this , , weltraummission einer .
well , they were also und and umfangreicher planung .
you go to these , , and then you 're man in these dark , tanzania environment , where no hope is going to save if you 're not getting back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just like i 'm in a . .
that 's really cool . ''
i was really obsessed by the study of the puzzle .
anyway , from the part that starts with curiosity and science . it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was funny .
and it was an experience that i could n't give for hollywood .
because , you know , i was able to do a figure for which we could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside the sehen .
in some of the things i 've seen , i 've seen creatures in gesehen , and sometimes things that i 've never seen before before , sometimes things that had n't seen any other before , and for the end of the time when we saw them , no words had found .
so that 's really , , and i wanted to .
and so i met something unusual .
after the success of `` vagina , '' i said , `` okay , i want to put my als as a symbol in hollywood to ice , and i 'm going to get for a while . ''
and then we started to do the '' , and they started with . .
we went back to the foreman of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which we built .
our goal was to come around and see the inside of the ship that never had done before .
no one ever had the inside of the erkundet system , and they did n't have a cure for it . so we developed the technology .
well , and there i am , at the der of the titanic , in a , , and see that there are some sort of place that i 'm going to know , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i 'm going to fly through a little bit of a durch durch .
i do n't care about it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i 'm living on the der of the titanic .
this was the kind of form form of a , that i 've ever experienced , because before i get around a corner , i always knew what was going on in the des of the car system , because i 'd finished months of gelaufen when we finished the film .
and the first thing was an actual copy of the des of the ship .
so it was a very strange experience .
it made me feel that i was aware that they use such avatare verwenden , and so that their minds in the vehicle can break into the other form of existence .
it was really profound .
and perhaps a little bit of view on what might possibly happen in some decades if you have hat to explore something to explore or to do other things that i can imagine as a vorstellen .
so after these begannen , we started what we saw in the bottom , and to learn that , for example , these , , where we 've seen these incredible amazing animals -- these are kind of , , but here is on effect .
they live with help .
they do n't exist in a sonnenlicht system that we do .
and this is how you see animals that are directly close to a 500 degree c , they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in , , which was back in my childhood aus .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and mit with nasa , and they sit in love with nasa , and they go to russia , and they moved to russia , along the mission of the mission , allem everything and then go to the international und , and take our mit .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of it , it was coming out that i took mit with us .
and i took them , and i took them access to the world in the bottom : , , leute , people who worked in these sorts of extreme situations . i took them to the sources so that they could go around , you know , nehmen instruments and so forth .
we were at mit , but we were actually aber science , we said , `` here we are . ''
so the circle between my existence as , , as a child as a child , as a child , as a child , was in the reality .
in the course , i learned a lot .
i 've learned a lot about science , but i 'm sure you 've got to have a director , a leader also has to be a leader .
but i do n't understand very much from leadership before i . these antrat .
because at one particular point i had to say , `` what do i actually do here ?
why do i do this ? what is it coming from ? ''
and this filme movies gives us a money .
we just play the production . we do
all of us think i was between the `` vagina '' and `` british '' and i 'd have . me in a dish on the beach .
i all have these films , these records , for a very small audience .
no homework , no money , no money . what do you do ?
you make it going to make the task of the challenge you 're going to lose the challenge , and the ocean is the most umgebung environment that you have . you 're doing it because of the verbindung , and because of the weird connection that comes out when a small group of people change a team .
because we 've only done this with 10 to 12 people who worked and worked for years of years . sometimes , we were two to three months .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have in common is that you have a task that you ca n't explain anything .
if you go to land , and you say , `` well , we had to do it , that hurt , the , , and the whole technology , the whole technology , and the problem in which we do n't explain the whole technology , and the problem , the human , , if you work in lake , then you ca n't explain the other thing . that 's like with police 's police or soldiers that have something in common and know that they can never explain anyone .
there is a link , a representative respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film `` memes , '' i tried to use the same thing that you 're going to pick up your team and take it inside the way .
it was really changing the dynamic .
so , again , i went back with a small team on top of terrain , and we said , `` follow , '' with a new technology that we have n't had .
that 's exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were for a period of four and a half years .
it 's changed in my way of films .
there were people who thought we had these ja , really well und on the planet .
for me , it was more for a art way of doing my job , the real process that changed in the process .
so what can we close from all this ?
what are the lessons we learned ?
i think , first , it 's curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human spirit .
our imagination is a force that actually can make a difference .
and the rate of your team has more important than all dieser of this world .
and i come up with a young bush that said , `` give me a advice as i can do something . ''
and i say , `` do n't give you a self .
that gets another for you . do n't do it yourself , otherwise not against yourself . but take risks on you . ''
nasa has such a : , `` failure is not an option . ''
but in fact , in art and learning , it needs to be an alternative , because it es a . .
no matter , that 's what 's called innovation .
you have to be willing to take these risks .
this is the idea that i 'd like to tell you with the way you want to go to the way . claim it 's an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i 'm going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and this is surprising to perhaps , because my bei at the foundation are mainly at the foundation of the field of the field of the field of the field that we 're doing , the things that we 're designing and offer to make the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate change are extremely important to these people , just more important than any other on the planet .
bedeutet means that their über will not grow over many years ; it 's too much too low . it 's going to be able to change the things that your terrible environment can do .
that leads to . . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to sign .
so , a change will be terrible for you .
and in fact , the für for them is very important .
in fact , if you could reduce the price of the price , it would be the most successful energy .
well , the ist is . over time .
in fact , the auf is energiefortschritten .
the trieb drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a fall case in the und , and that 's why we have business , wir , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we increase the price -- let 's take the price of the price -- let 's make it a new layer , and it 's on co2 .
co2 is the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they das the co2 of carbon , which leads to führt , and they have a lot of very negative effects , and they have a lot of very negative effects to the weather , and perhaps worse , the collective principles that the natural ecosystems are n't able to adapt so much of these veränderungen changes and make whole systems .
now , the same relationship between the und and the resultierende und and where the other rule is there are some of the , , but not very many .
and there 's certainly darüber about how bad those effects are , but they 're extremely bad .
i asked the mehrmals several times , `` are we really moving to zero ?
does n't give up half or a quarter ? ''
and the answer is , until we get to zero , the temperature will continue down .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different to say that we have a professional feet of high miles that have to come under a million feet of an brücke bridge , and that 's what we can then look at .
that 's the way down to zero .
well , we moved every year a lot of aus , over 85 billion tons .
every americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it 's about five tons of it on earth .
and somehow we need to make changes , which is available to zero .
it 's konstant .
it 's only different economic changes at all , and we need to go from anstieg of carbon dioxide and to go to a remote and a bis .
this equation has four factors . it 's a little bit of . . you 've left this thing on the left -- co2 -- you want to get down zero , and that 's going to affect the number of people , from the service that everyone is using the average one in the average , the average energy for every service and co2 , the average energy .
so let 's look at each other , and let 's start to let that get to zero .
probably one of these numbers have very close to zero .
now this is the fundamental prototype , but let 's go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today , 1,100 billion people live .
and it 's looking at nine billion to move to nine billion .
if we were very successful with new , and gesundheitsvorsorgung and sind , we would probably reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but at least , we see a um .
the second factor are areas that we use .
that 's all the food that we eat , clothing , tv , . .
these are very good things and bedeutet means to make it almost any one on the planet .
it 's great that this number gets up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could be able to do machen and nutzen less , but in average , the number is going to increase every year , and so it will be more than free , the number of services going to be brought up per person .
what we 're looking at here is a very fundamental service , is there at home so that you can read the homework ,
and those students do n't have it , so they go out and read their unter under the . .
now , at efficiency , the , , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that does n't go down .
because of different success in the , , through other , , through new forms in , , there are lots of services whose energy benefits to some individual services in the 90 percent .
in other conflict , like the power of , , 00:05:56,000 -- -- 00:05:58,000 oder , or , oder , or a oder or a , or a , or a , , is a lot of a little smaller to crisis .
in fact , if we 're optimistic , we may be able to save a line about a factor three or maybe a factor .
but in the first three factors , we went from 26 billion to perhaps 13 billion tons , and that 's just not going on .
so , let 's look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a dangerous -- this is the amount of co2 that 's going to be wird per emittiert .
it turns out whether you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn gas : no .
almost each für for electricity is co2 today , except for renewables and . .
so , what we need to do in a global scale is a new system .
we need . .
now , if i use the term `` wonder , '' i do n't have the impossible .
the gecko 's a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
the people here are paid to the development of many of these miracles .
normally there is no punishment to take a miracle to a particular thing .
normally you 're just looking at it and some of you .
but in this case , we have to give a geben , and we have to get a miracle in very short time .
now , i was thinking , how can i really ? this ?
is there a natural place , a list which is the idea of people here ?
i remember the last year when i got cell and somehow i kind of loved people .
the idea was , for them , you know , that there are people who are alive .
for energy , i got this one .
i decided that the von of mein can be made to the environment .
so here are some natural variability .
you 've told me that they do n't know . they do n't even get the glass .
well , there are all kinds of things like this , but they do n't do much .
we need solutions , either one who have an enormous amount of scale , and incredible haben , and even though there are many ways that people are looking for me , i really only see five who can do these great needs .
i have , , fusion , und and ausgelassen .
now , this could be a beitrag effort , and if you do better than i expect you , it would be great , but my doubt here is that we have to work in all of these five pieces , and we ca n't have one of them because they were stupid , because all have real problems .
let 's first look first at the air chain tank , von of either coal or gas .
what you have to do is it 's easy , but it 's not . you 've got to have all that carbon that 's coming out of the air air , you know , in pressure , and then there 's und and hope that there are there .
there are a few , that creates this on a 60 percent of 80 percent , but that 's going to get to 100 percent of it , but it 's going to become 100 percent to produce extremely difficult -- and one of the für for the co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the . .
who will make it happen ?
who can , something that 's literally a lot of billion billion times more than any kind of waste that can imagine from und and other things ?
that 's a lot of punch .
so this is a tough . .
next , . .
they 've also had three big problems : the cost , the cost in ländern countries . the question of security is to make sure nothing is going to go out , despite the human being that is not being used for weapons .
and what do you do with this waste ?
because even though it 's not very large , it has a lot to think .
so three very difficult problems that might be unexpected , and that 's what you ought to work with .
the last three of the five years i 've done .
it 's the renewables as it often werden .
and even though it 's great , it 's great that they do n't need government . they have some ingredients .
one of them is , in one of these technologies , these technologies are increasingly lower than the kraftwerken .
that 's , , you 're talking about a lot of , , a thousand more room than a normal power .
also , these are the sources .
the sun does n't seem all the day , they do n't seem to see every single day , and the wind , they do n't always know the wind .
and that 's why you need to get away from these sources , the energy , the energy in times if you 're not available to get it .
so there 's a big . . there are challenges in the non-zero-sum industry . if we say that the energy is outside the country , you do n't only need the technology , you have to deal with the risk that the energy of where different comes from .
and there 's the . .
and to show the dimension , i 'm all kinds of thousands of tribes that are made , looking at cars , computers , für , for everything . and that 's what i 've been doing with the most amount of chemical energy that the world is using the world , and i found that all the tribes that we 're developing now are going to get less than 10 minutes of the lagern .
so what we need is , we need a big deal , which is that it 's going to be a factor of 100 times when you have a zur .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not that easy .
that 's what happens when you try to say to these quellen sources of say about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the population .
if you want to remove 100 percent of them , you need an incredible . .
now , where are we going to go -- what 's the right approach ?
so what do we get to the end ?
what we need is a lot of companies who are working on this .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
and many of you will say that 's crazy ! that 's good .
i think there in the ted group , there are many , which have already existed .
bill 's has a whole bunch of companies , a esolar that has great hat .
khosla investiert companies in hundreds of companies do the great things , and interesting opportunities and i try to support that .
nathan und and i hate a company , which , perhaps , , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the ; ; , , . .
the development has stopped in this industry for some time , so it 's not a great surprise that some good concepts .
the thing that means instead of , you know , instead of , you know , instead of , a part of the , , the one percent that we decided , we decided to , the 99 percent .
that 's a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've got a long time about it , but you could n't have noticed that it 's going to work , but since the modern sector , you can see it and see that : yes , with the right one , it looks like it 's a . .
and because you burn the 99 percent , it 's a lot better .
in fact , you can use that waste , and you can even use the von of today as benutzen .
instead of , the head , you burn it . a great thing .
the gray is being used to translate a little bit more like a rock .
you can see it 's a kind of a ist , often , it 's often like `` any wave . ''
this really matters the problem .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is , . it 's 99 percent . you have the part , which is closed today , so it 's called a uran .
this is the cover for hundreds of thousands of years .
and if you 're just , and filtriert , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's lots of challenges there , but it 's an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to get beyond .
let 's think how to measure our success .
how should our finance look look like this ?
well , let 's go until the target that we have to achieve , and then we 're talking about the . .
a lot of talk from a 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it 's really really important that we get there .
the rest 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and it will still be something agriculture . hopefully it will be und and bis to be clean .
so to reach that 80 percent has to change the world , including countries like china , their komplett completely .
the other note is , if we 're using technology 's technology , whether it 's used in any developed countries and we 're on the way to get them to the rest .
that 's great important .
this will be a key of this .
if we go back , how would the secret look like ?
it was supposed to have the two elements .
we should use the nutzen to get samples in the way . the less of us , the less we will be in charge of them , and then the temperature will be the temperature .
but in fact , that note is the things that we consume , that we do n't fully lead to the large führen , only the same , or even a little bit less than the other , which is the basis of innovation to these ecosystems .
so , we do n't need to have this kind of verfolgen and we can measure : in , , in und and . .
there are many great books on this topic .
al gore wrote `` we have the choice . ''
they really go through and create a framework in which these reefs can be solved , because we need support of all sides .
there 's a lot of that .
that 's an example .
a very wunsch wish that we invent this technology .
now , if you go for a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , one of them , and that 's that i love , or i could choose this wish that 's going to be energiepreis ohne without carbon . this is what i 'm going to do .
that 's the biggest impact .
if we do n't get this wish , it will be zwischen between the period and denkenden people , between the united states and china , between poor and rich countries . and almost all of these two billion are very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do for that ?
we need to use for more crime .
in places like countries , they do n't need to talk about carbon .
and you should walk these besprechen , and you would be von by the very successful , very low , that will be spent for these incredible ausgegeben .
we need , , we need co2 control , and we need a trade , which is a schafft .
we need to spread the message .
we need to have to make attention , and we need to do things that are being used by government .
it 's an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . just to understand anything better -- first , can you give us a notion of scale of this investment ?
and bill gates : in order to do the simulation on a durchzuführen , all the big scientists , what we 've done , we 've only got a few 10 million . and even if we 've done our materials in a russian event to make sure that it 's working , it 's only in the millionen million .
the difficult step is the building of the first , to come to another billion , the und and the location of the real of these .
once the first ever ever is , if he 's going to go like that , then everything is clear , because the economy , the ist is so different than what we know .
to understand that , that means deep in the soil , almost like a säule of nuclear nuclear brennstoffs , is that `` the process , '' and then the process goes up , and does it continue down ?
bg : exactly . now you 've got to have the map up there , so there are many people and a lot of trying to go out of time . this thing where you can open it up and you 're doing things like that , and that 's not good .
but if you have very cheap gas , you can use it for 60 years -- think of one thing -- you 're in charge , without all the . .
and it sits there and shoots 60 years long , and it 's done .
it 's an incredible one , it 's a solution for waste .
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the waste : you can sit it up -- there 's a lot less waste with this technology -- then you take it and you put it in the next and burn it .
and we 're starting to take the transition that exists in those oder or bei in the legs . that 's our . .
so that 's what 's been a problem for these who is , what we 're going to do in our life , and that 's what we 're going to get out of this process in the process .
but while they talked about different people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , what really does ?
bg : well , we do n't have a place on a place , and there 's a lot of interesting für for everything that is . in the name . there 's big interest in the name . there 's big interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , india , china -- i was here and i 've met the gun and talked about how it does to work .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
that 's an alternative one . it 's been done .
this is an important step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor , and some countries have this built , and this is so every one who has made a fast made of a fast made , a für for our first .
in your mind , und and chance to call something in life ?
bg : well , we need one of these , , dinge things that are very cheap , that we have 20 years to invent and then to use 20 years .
and that 's kind of like the novelty that has pointed us into the aufgezeigt that we need .
and , you know , wenn , if everything goes well , and that 's a great wish to think that .
and luckily , today are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of people who work , as their funktionieren work , who can work and work on their program .
and it would be at the best time if it 's got a couple of them , because then you could
we need a solution .
are the big possible species , is this the biggest , you know ?
bg : a ist is allerwichtigste .
it would have been that they have n't had the gewesen , but it 's a lot more important .
in the incredible sector , there are other kinds of companies .
you know , we do n't know their work as good as they do , but there is the underlying method , it 's a different approach .
there 's a reaktortyp , , which seems kind of difficult , but maybe it 's telling us this .
and so there 's a lot of different , but the nice thing about this is that a eine of a million times as much energy is like one , say , a und and therefore , when you can deal with the problems , and that are mainly the radiation , the quality and the cost , the potential , the potential to the country and other things , it 's almost in a personal island .
if that does n't work , what ?
do we need to be einleiten to try to try and try to keep the stabil stable ?
bg : if you get into this situation , it 's as if you 've eaten too much , and just before a heart attack , what do you do ? you need to have a oder or something .
there 's a die that 's , sich , which seems with different techniques to , warming , so that we spend 20 or 30 years more for us .
that 's just a . .
you know we do n't need that .
some people say that you should not be working on insurance because you might be familiar , so you 're going to continue to eat it because you know that it 's going to save the retten .
i do n't know if it 's smart if you put the importance of this problem in front of you , but there 's a mathematician in darüber about whether you have to have it , if things get faster faster or that innovation is longer than we would expect .
climate change : do you have a or two sentences to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , we 've got the career in very different boxes .
those who make scientific care are very little .
do you tell that there are negative effects that are going to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can all say that there are a chance in a million .
so this is kind of like your interaction .
you make it 's wrong now , and you give it much later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of probleme problems to invest in something that you 've only been thinking about , and it 's not that investment is not so clear . in fact , it 's not just the worst animal and there 's people in the rich world who look at it and say , okay , that 's not a huge thing .
the fact is that these uncertainty should worry about us .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and the co2 goes forward , say , `` okay , it does n't tell me that it 's not co2 , , i wish it was that , but i 'm going to accept it , because it 's cheaper than the previous method . ''
and that would be their response to the lomborg argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all of the other goals that have , all the other goals , the , , the von of malaria , and so on , it 's a warm force of resources to invest money , while it better things that we can do .
bg : well , the real exchange for research -- say , we do n't spend 10 billion per year than you do today -- that 's not so dramatic .
there should not be other things .
you get to big , , and there 's two people , when you have something that 's not worth economic , and trying to do that , for me , most of them happened .
it 's because , you know , it 's very short in a und and nur , and i do n't think we should have more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the , you get , a very high ist , then you can only keep the rich .
i mean , every one of us could spend five times as much more for our energy to change their lives .
for the lower two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even denkt thinking .
his new ist is : `` why is n't we even even even more interesting ? ''
it 's still being still , because of its previous stories , with the assoziiert device , but it 's got to have understood that this is a very simple group , and so he 's going to get it right now .
and that 's a line i think for appropriate .
the research , it 's crazy as little as it gets .
bill , i think i 'm talking about almost all people here when i say i really hope that your desire is true . thank you .
bg : thank you .
some years ago , here at ted , peter einen was a namens called `` the '' . ''
the idea is quite simple . müssen has to have the biggest struktur structure with 20 , , about klebeband island , about klebeband , , about faden structures and a bauen .
the department has to be on the top .
and , although it 's really easy , it 's really hard for people to do it very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a verwandelt .
it was a huge success .
since then , i 've done about 70 media across the world , with students , und and architects , even with der of people , and there 's something about this problem , which is a deep visualization in the nature of collaboration and i 'd like to share some of them .
usually , most people think about the task themselves .
you talk about it , you 're thinking about how it 's going to look , you 're um .
then they invest a little time in planning and organization : they und and spaghetti aus .
they invest in all of their time in the developed world .
and finally , soon before you do n't have any time , take someone to the mast , and you put it on the top , you put it back , and you put it back , and you put it back , and you put it back , and you put it back , and you put your work down .
but what happens is , almost always , is that the `` '' '' is going to a `` '' '' because the weight of the field is to make the whole thing a und and . .
there are a number of people who have a lot more called '' -momente than others , and the worst are new . .
they lie , they cheat , they 're confused , they 're producing gebilde shapes .
and of course , we also have a team who has a lot more called '' , and among the best ones are fresh des .
and that 's pretty amazing .
as we do n't , peter told us not only to do the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of everyone .
what you might ask is , what is that ? why ? what about that ?
and peter said , `` none of the kids spend time in the door of the gmbh zu . ''
they do n't spend any time in . .
but there 's another reason .
and it 's that they have been trained to find a particular plan .
and then he started to realize .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you do n't have time and what 's going to happen ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what makes a difference differently is that it 's starting to start with the beginnen and prototypes together , successful prototypes , and at the top end to the top , so they die the way they have the opportunity to repair more prototypes .
erkennen , this kind of collaboration , as a result of an vorgangs .
and with each other experiments , the children are getting close to what works and do n't .
so the power is to work with prototypes -- but let 's look at how different team do .
the average for most of you are about in about , , schaffen , half of those , blogs do n't create a lot more , but not much , sind are better than adults .
who 's in the fall ?
architects , engineers , happiness .
ist is the only thing i 've seen .
and why ? because they understand , they learn , and they are able to do these research patterns , the key to build existing structures .
leadership is something about average . but it gets interesting .
if you want to put an oil on the team , you will make a difference .
it 's just incredible . you can see , and this team is going to win . ''
you can predict this . why is it ?
because they have special skills of what they 've done .
they den the process . they understand him .
and that team , the strength and the work , will make the performance of the team complex .
tremendous skills and ngos and their models lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical function , you get about six , the active structure .
i was trying to do something now .
i thought , we put the gleich in the same .
so i set up a $ dollars of software for the subway .
so , what do you think about this ? ?
what was the result ?
here 's what happened . not a new team had a three-dimensional structure .
if someone could have a hohe and a hohe , he would have access home to home .
so is this not interesting that high einen have a strong effect ?
we made this practice with the same students .
what do you think now ?
now they understand the advantage of the prototyping .
and so in the same , bad team of one among the best .
they reduce the highest development in the very time .
there are lektionen lessons for us , about the nature of power and success .
and you might ask , why would you ever make any time to make a difference ?
the reason is , i create digital tools and process to help team , cars and video games and visual '' .
and what it does is it 's going to help them get hidden assumptions .
because , in fact , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge to create a common experience , a common language of language , den , the right mountains .
and this is the value of this experience , which is so simple .
and those of you who are interested in is besuchen .
it 's a blog where you see how to create baut .
there 's a dort there .
they find crazy examples from all the world like people und the system .
there 's also . .
and the most important lesson , i think , is that the art is actually a sport artist .
it wants us to focus all of our senses to the task , and that we will use our thinking of how our emotions and our beliefs , in the challenge that we have .
and sometimes , a small prototype of this experience is everything it takes us from one `` '' '' -- to make a `` '' . ''
and this can make a big difference .
thank you .
let 's have a machine .
a big machine , a cool machine machine , and that 's a time .
and everybody in this room has to get in .
and they can go in the past , they can go into the future ; they ca n't be in here and they can remain .
and i wonder what they would choose because i 've asked my friends in front of the time , and they wanted to have everyone in the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back in time before , before they got cars or twitter , `` america 's looking for me . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced you 're kind of a kind of sense of being hingezogen .
and i understand that .
i 'm not part of that group , i must say .
i do n't want to go into the past , and that does n't , because i 'm a writer .
it 's because possibilities do n't go back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into that machine and i want to go into the future .
this is the most biggest time that ever gave it on the planet , no matter what scale you make : health , wealth , inequality , opportunities , krankheitsraten . .
there was never a time like this .
my starben died were all when they were 60 .
my grandparents tried this number to 70 .
my parents are 80 in the 1970s .
so there was better a nine out of my stehen .
but it 's not even about people like us , because that 's a bigger thing than that .
a kid who was born today in new york , as long as the arab man in the world was 100 years ago .
think about it . that 's an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billion people on this planet .
you have the der of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we got them . . .
in the rich world , there are diseases that millions of us have a billion percent of us .
, , kinderlähmung , ... ...
does anybody know what that is ?
blocks , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are more than the scientific method .
and from my view of view , the scientific method is to try and see if it works to change if it does n't do that if it does n't do that , one of the great income in humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , it 's all good news , because there 's some other problems , and they 've mentioned plenty .
and one of them is , despite all of us , a billion people on the world can go to bed every day .
that number is rising , and it gets very fast , and that 's odd .
and not just that , we used our imagination to adapt the world .
water , land land , diplomacy , oil , gas : you go down , and that 's soon , and if we do n't go out of this chaos , we 'll go from it .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think it 's already .
i think it 's clear that we can make food to feed the billions of people , without the country they live in .
and i think we can calculate the world with energy that they 're not . .
i do n't think that , and no , this is not a . .
but this raises me -- -- one of the things that i remember at night is , we 've never had to do scientific progress as it did n't like now .
and we 've never had to be able to do it in the same way that it would look like this , and we can do it now .
we 're in the verge of amazing , amazing events on lots of places . and yet i think that we should go back hundreds of , 300 years before the training , to find a time where we 've done progress , where we 've done about these kinds of things that we 've done about more than now .
people were sich in their faith , and it 's so deeply they ca n't release them .
it 's not even the truth .
and listen , everyone has a right at its opinion ; even a right thing .
but you know what she does n't do right ?
they do n't have any right to their own facts . , . have n't .
and i needed a time to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about `` the new yorker , '' a little article .
and i was amazed to get on resistance , based on to what the most effective impact in health care in the history of humanity .
i did n't know what to do , so i just do what i always do , i wrote a paper and left .
and soon , i wrote an article about veränderte nahrungsmittel .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so , i wrote an article about this , and i could n't understand why people thought that would be called '' , why they thought molecules on a particular one , rather than a random species of einen , a auf that was in the area of nature .
but you know , i 'm doing what i do . i wrote the articles , i went on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we create , we tend to be food , that 's okay .
but this article was worried , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i found out .
and that 's because those of these things that were made me crazy was not the waren .
these were leute people , leute people , leute people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that made me so smart .
but then i thought , you know what , let 's be honest .
we 're at a point where we do n't have the same relationship with progress like earlier .
we talk about davon .
we talk of davon , using little darum , `` progress . ''
okay , there are reasons to that , and i think we know what the reasons is .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there 's no reason why it should n't be .
you can just use some names and people will understand .
, , die , challenger , massenvernichtungswaffen , die , , us-präsidentschaftswahl . .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people who believed that they 're always going to be right . so they 're forced .
ask you , ask the evidence , ask the evidence .
take nothing up .
but here 's the thing : if you have to get the evidence , you have to get this evidence and we 're not good at it .
and i can tell that from the reason we live in an epidemic of fear , like i 've never seen you , and hopefully i 'll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story called mit , und , impfstoff community .
very scary .
there are hundreds of studies in studies to see if this was happening .
hundreds of studies should be done ; this is a serious deal .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right , no race , no connection , no one connection .
it does n't make any difference . it does n't make any difference , because we believe in physics , we believe what we see what we see , what causes us that we feel real .
we do n't think about a dozen of the study of an , that we have data , and i understand that , i think we all do it .
but you know what ?
the result of it was , .
for example , this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world , in which we have sex for hackers .
that 's massive and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happens is that we could do that .
now i understand that . i do that .
because anybody cares ?
have a single one in the audience in the audience ?
it does n't happen very well .
in this country , it does n't exist at all .
that 's a lot of death by adolescents , 20 per hour .
but because this is n't what it is happening here , we can predict it , and people like incentives can go around and messages from fear and dozens of people like und and larry king live .
and they can make you , because they do n't connect and regulate them .
they do n't understand these things seem to be too , but never the same thing .
and that 's something that we have to learn , and it 's very quickly .
this guy was a hero , anonymous brilliant .
he invites us from one of the worst der in humanity .
no fear , no copyright , puff , verschwunden .
the guy in the middle , not so much .
he 's called paul . .
he just developed some other people a few other people .
it can save the lives of , , 500 children per year into the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well that 's good , despite the fact that paul und and about deep talk and says how valuable they are , and that people just should stop .
and that 's what he 's actually saying .
so paul is a . .
if paul was talking to a public spricht , he ca n't do without wächter .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where his children wants to school .
and why ? because paul has done a horse .
i do n't need to say that , but look are a tool .
take your lower , go back to the diseases , get terrible diseases , and that 's what happened .
we 're now . in this country .
and that 's getting worse , and pretty soon kids are dying again , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not only going to die at random .
what about ultrasound ? let 's make it . why not ?
a von of mine wrote me a few weeks ago , and i told you i 'm a little schrill .
nobody ever said that .
she would n't have kinderlähmung her kid against impfen .
poignant .
why ? because we do n't have any haben , and you know what ?
we did n't know in this country .
now , i do n't know , you might put this morning a plane morning , and if you go to los angeles , at the moment it 's about to strangers .
and in a couple of hours , he goes and ein a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's going to come to one of these ted-dinner heute today tonight .
and he does n't know that he was infected with a krankheit illness , and we do n't know , because this is how the world works now .
that 's the planet we live alive . do n't do it as if it 's not .
we love to . ourselves . we love that .
do you have all your wallet in this morning ?
, , a little bit of , that 's trying to help you .
i know they did that because half of the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative care , and it makes no difference how often we find out that they 're useless .
the data passes all the time .
they separate their instructions . you do n't .
that 's okay , you 'd like to pay percent billion dollars for dark people .
i agree with them completely .
dark icebergs . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do it ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the peace industry .
we hate a strong government . we do n't trust trust .
and we should n't be able to do that . our health system
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and selbst itself that can afford it .
so we 're going away before , and where do we go ?
we 're running into the poor poor .
that 's great . i love the . .
but you know , it 's a serious problem , because the stuff is expected , and we spend billions of dollars .
and i 've got all kinds of notes here .
none of them -- , , echinacea , acai , da , because i do n't even know what this is , but we 're taking billions of dollars into it .
and you know what ? when i tell that to people and say , `` what is it ? let 's make people what they want .
that 's how they feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it does n't matter whether it 's the health economy that says , `` hmm , i 'm going to have to have the leadership of my hair to choose to nicht or to some , who wants to treat his patients with behandeln .
if you go to this way where you believe , and magic evidence and science , you get to a place where you want to be .
they get to mbeki in in south africa .
he brought twice his people around because he was that red , , und and viel are much more efficient than the medikamente drugs that we know that they can capture the information from aids .
hundreds of thousands of tode deaths in a country that gets worse than any other from this disease .
tell me not that these things have no consequences .
they always have . they 've always got them .
well , the epidemie epidemic in which we are at right now is this profound fight between the gentechnisch veränderter of the ability and the . .
it 's a debatte debate . it 's got to stop .
it 's a debate on words , about metaphor .
that 's right , not science .
everything that we eat , every , , every protein , every petersilie , has changed by people .
you know , there was no photoshop in the garden .
there was no . .
there was no accident . we did everything .
we 've done it in the last 30 years .
and some of it 's working , and it 's not .
we get rid of it .
now , we can do it again . and of course there 's risks . but we can do something like vitamin one in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , have millions of people .
you do n't want to do that ?
i have to say , i do n't understand .
we shoot our food food .
why do we do it ?
now , what i 'm going to hear is , to many chemicals , you know , you do n't want to get huge areas with one thing that is wrong .
we do n't want to have a living life .
we do n't want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is all about this ?
yeah , they 're right . let 's do that .
it 's true , we have a huge problem , but that 's not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it 's right , morality , . .
you know the science is not a company .
it 's not land .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it does n't , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because it 's a real one , and it takes millions of people out of it .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 'll have 70 percent more food than the moment , 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
odd . odd .
you need that , and we do n't give them .
and why ? veränderte changes food .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this zeug stuff like . .
it 's something that has half a billion people .
it 's something like a . .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's binary .
it has no water , it has no protein , and scientists build all of this .
and then people could eat it and would n't be blind .
they would n't ignore , and you would know what ?
that would be beautiful . it would n't be panisse , , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say to you , why are we fighting this ?
i mean , let 's ask . why do we fight this ?
because do n't we want genes wollen ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our leidenschaft passion for insulin foods , our strength on higher food , better food , absolute food .
it 's not about beautiful , ; it 's about taking people alive , and it 's going to be very time to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do it , if we are going to do so far , we do have something to something about , i think , i think , is not to be compassionate , we think .
there 's no other description for what 's going on here .
it 's thicker , it 's ugly , it 's our impossible , and we really have to stop it .
so after this incredible event , you might want to say , `` do you still want to und and go into the future ? ''
anyway . i want you to do that .
right now , it 's in present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can all look at what we want .
we can do what we want them to do , and we 're going to get them there where we want .
we need to have that conversation , and we need to think , but if we go to work in the time and in the future we will be happy to have that done .
i know we can , and look at this is what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i 've actually been interested in the . . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in , it 's because it looks like me , as `` a deception that will be something to something real , if somebody 's not going to believe enough . ''
in other words , haben have been shown in some studies a structure for the , , and it 's only because the person thinks what to do with it is a oder or a kind of -- in the , , for example , when the patient is just able to believe , a sustainable effect in the body called the nennt .
a deception is going to be true because somebody is so much .
so to each other , i want to give you a piece of a fundamental , very simple approach .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick that 's been at least since the genocide in any für for children .
i 'm going to have learned by the scout magic der pfadfinder pfadfinder .
i will do it for you and then explain it .
and then i 'm going to explain why i 'm going to explain it
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand you can study .
i 'll just hold this up in my hand .
i swear my refrigerator back .
and to make sure that nothing in my dough goes down or from him , i 'm just going to give my genau right here .
in this way , you can see that there 's something going on in this way , so as long as i 'm here , i ca n't go in love with you .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully that if it 's good , it will be warm through my körperlichen physical festgehalten .
it 's actually so deeply , in fact , that i can shake it without that the horse . .
nothing else in my wife or comes out , do n't have any . . and they can study everything .
! !
now , this is a trick that i often , kindern kids who are looking for magic , because you can actually learn a lot about deception , even though it 's a very simple thing .
you probably know many of you in the room in the room .
he works this way .
i think that knife in my hand .
i say that i 'm going to , my ritual to make sure that there is nothing in my ipod and pull out , and that 's a lie .
the reason i , my ritual is that there is the whole secret of the illusion .
in the moment , i 'm going to tell you my hand from you , so you can see it from the back , you 're going to move this finger here , my , , just off where he was , in a position where he 's so stupid .
amazing trick .
there is somebody who did n't have a childhood .
so he 's here . right .
and when i , , it changes its position .
and now you might talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't get to see the fact that there is only three to you , because your mind and the way it does information , it does n't matter , one , two , three , it 's as a group .
but this is actually not right now , and then i open my hand .
of course , it 's , , but it 's not through the meines of my body , but it 's through a trick through my , who 's here .
and if i waited my hand , the same thing i 'm going to go through is through the movement that the fingers is going to . .
i take that hand away . and here 's the glue .
this trick you can do your friends and neighbors , thank you .
now , what did this have to do with the problem ?
a year or so , i read a study that i really did right on .
i 'm not a doctor or a scientist , and that 's why for me was an amazing thing .
and it turns out that if you put a in in the form of a white ball , in the form of a , , the shape is just a tiny , white ball that has a particular source effect .
but if you give the shape that you give in the verabreichen , for example , in a smaller ball , and that blue und , and a copy on it , it 's actually dumb efficient .
and that , although no of any ... -- it 's just . .
but a white ball is n't as good as a blue ball .
what ? it made me really crazy .
but it turns out that it 's not all .
and if you take nitrogen , you 're more likely to have a more cell form .
it 's a kapsel facility that 's on a end of yellow and other star , it 's better than a white concert .
also the spielt play a role .
a lot of a ball for two hours is not as good as three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact facts . i 'm sorry .
the key thing is ...
... well , it also seems to play a role .
and the shape play a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate haben , you 've got to get a needle .
right ? a servant with a - -- a few einer of a substanz substance you put on a patient .
it creates a very strong picture in its head . it 's very much more than a white ball .
this graph is really -- i 'm going to show you another time if we 've got a haben .
so the fact is , the white boxes do n't work as well as the blue ball that does n't seem as well as a , , that does n't seem as well as the needle .
and none of it has a really physical property . it 's just our belief that makes us a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a tool .
i suppose something that is a deception is a deception , and let 's just look at it .
we know from the study that you have to get up to the needle when it 's going to go .
this is a 18 inches long , and it 's very , very high , and i 'm going to have a little bit of a . .
this is really my meat . it 's not spezielles special fleisch .
this is my skin . this is not a aus from hollywood .
so i 'm going to put this needle into my skin , and i 'm going to go through it through the other side of the side .
if you 're missing , if you 're going to fall out and fall out -- i 've met a couple of friends last night in the morning , and some people i do n't know , and there 's a woman become almost disappointed .
so what i 'm suggesting is , if you 're going to lose your fast , you look for the next 30 seconds , or you know what i 'm going to do the first thing in front of here .
you can see it right there , it can be , , if you want .
so , it 's like , right here where my meat starts like , at the bottom of my day , i will just make a small machen .
i 'm so sorry . does it crazy ?
and just a little bit about my skin and on the other side .
now we are actually in the same situation that we had when we had hatten .
about .
but now you ca n't count my finger , right ?
so , i 'll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see it .
they say , `` okay , it 's not so stupid and sich even the skin , except for us to have a few minutes . ''
well , then i 'll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people said , `` okay . i do n't see that . ''
the people in the kommen come in .
let me show you from that close .
this is really my skin . this is not a aus from hollywood .
that 's my meat , and i can do that .
sorry . so if you get evil , you look away , look at it .
and the people at the top , or they said , `` well , that 's going to say that there 's going to be looking at a video , and they 'll say , `` well , this looks right , but if it would really , he would be -- look at this hole , there is a hole and there , if it really was really , it would be appropriate . ''
okay , let me give you a little bit of blood for you .
yes , here it is .
and i 'd like to take the needle away now .
i would clean my arm and show them that there was no punishment .
but i think , in this frame , with the purpose of being real real , i 'm going to just go down the needle and go out of the stage .
we 'll notice in the next few days a few times .
i hope you 'll enjoy me . thank you .
everybody 's talking about happiness .
i 've got some people to impact the number of books that have been published in the last five years , and they gave for about 40 , and there was many more .
there are an enormous wave of the interest of happiness .
there 's a lot of . .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but in fact , despite all of these laws of working , there 's several cognitive , that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to act from these power .
this is true for , , that you think about your own happiness , and it 's also for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that it 's exactly as well as anybody else .
the first of these ist is a , of complexity .
it turns out that the word `` happiness is just not intelligent word is because we apply it to many different things .
i think there 's a certain kind of meaning that we could take it out of it , but it 's a huge and whole one that we need to give up , and we 'll have to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a von of experience and memory : basically , it is between happy to life in its life , and be happy with its life or happy with its life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the , , and that is the most surprising fact that we can not think of the way of being able to engage the well-being without the meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive situation .
there 's just no way to get it right there .
well , i 'd like to talk about one example of someone who had a hatte , after one of my , , who was a story -- [ unclear -- ] he would have heard a gehört , and it was absolutely stupid music , and at the end of the shot there was a kreischendes sound .
and then he put it on , really , really smooth , it turned all the experience .
but it did n't .
what it turns was the memory of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he gave 20 minutes of music for 20 minutes
it was n't because it was war with a memory of memory ; the memory was made , and the memory was everything he got to keep .
what really tells us is that we may think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there is a selbst self that lives in the present and know that the past is able to experience the past , but basically only the present .
it 's the selbst self , the doctor -- -- you know , when the doctor asks , `` do it hurt when i put it out there ? ''
and then there 's a selbst self , and the selbst self is this , the und and the history of our lives , and it 's a way that the doctor will tell the question , `` how did you have felt in the last time ? ''
or `` what did your journey was to fight ? '' or something like that .
these are two very different categories , the selbst self and the selbst self , and the two to ist is part of the des of vom of happiness .
well , the average self is a statement .
and that really begins with a fundamental response on our memories -- it starts immediately .
we do n't just tell stories if we make ourselves to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we 're saving is a story .
and let me start with a example .
there 's an old study .
these are real patients , which gives them a prozedur .
i will not go into detail . it 's no longer painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all the sekunden of her pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're going to ask , who 's got more of them ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
now , patient b has had a lot more , his war has been longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a woman , and more .
but now there is another question : how much did these patients feel that they were looking at ?
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a much more sophisticated an can have a patient , as a patient b .
it was different stories , and because a very important part of the history is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very oder , great -- but one of them is clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and those who are worse , where the pain was on the end on the end on the end . it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their gefragt , and also a lot later , `` how bad was the whole thing ? ''
and she was much worse for a minute for b in . .
now , this is an extraordinary conflict between the selbst self and the selbst itself .
from the point of the selbst self , b has a zeit time .
now , what you could do with your patient is , and we actually have clinical experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually get the von out of the patient , you just do n't want to put it out of the building without . it too much .
that 'll lead the patient , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you make that a few minutes a few minutes , you 've got it to be a bad one , and you 've got it to be a much better one , but now you have a better history of history about his experience .
what is a story in that ?
and that 's true for the stories that makes memory of us and it 's also for the stories we invent .
so it turns out a story is , , augenblicke , critical moments and end .
end up is very , very important , and in this case , the end .
now , the selbst self lives its life .
it has moments of , , one after another .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they lost .
i mean , most of you all of our life -- and i 've done that -- you know that psychological work are about three seconds as it is , you know , there 's about 600 million of these . in a month there are about 6,000 million of them . most of them do n't leave up .
most of them are completely lost by the selbst themselves .
and yet , in the sense of the meaning that they have to count , that what is happening during this period of view is our life .
it 's the kind of resource we consume in the world .
and as we can use it hard , but that 's not the story we 're going to keep it back for us .
so we even have the selbst self , and the selbst self , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is a time .
from the selbst self , if you have an operation and the second week as well as the first , then the urlaub minister twice twice as good as the urlaub lama .
that does n't work at all of the selbst self .
for the sake of mind , a urlaub drone can hardly be better than the urlaub , because there are no new memories .
they have n't changed the story .
and in this way , it 's a matter of critical property , which is kind of a selbst self with a selbst self , has very little impact on this story .
now , the selbst self makes up more than trying to remember and tell stories .
it 's actually how it makes decisions , because if you have a patient who 's got a patient , you 've got two bei at two different surgeons , and decide what he 's supposed to vote , then , that 's where the implications of the people who have memory is less bad , and that 's the surgeon who will be chosen .
the average self has no voice in this choice .
we do n't choose between experience . we choose from love to experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't usually think of our future as experience .
we think about our future as erinnerungen memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as an extension of the selbst self , and you can think of the selbst self as one that is the same kind of selbst self through the experience that the selbst self does n't need .
i 've got the sense that if we 're going to make emails , it 's very often the case , that means we 're going to make weitestgehend just in the fields of selbst itself .
and that 's a little bit hard to do , i think .
i mean , how much are we doing about our memories ?
this is one of the main examples that was given for the des self .
and if i think about it , i think about a lens that we had a few years ago , which is the best time i had ever had , and i think relatively often in terms of how often i think of other denke .
and i 've probably got some of my memories on this reise journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i had the dancing mosquito , i could have spent a couple of dollars in my hands .
well , these are three weeks , and this is both a . .
there seems to be a dialogue .
well , i like to be a little bit , you know , it 's a little bit , as little as i 'm doing , i do n't have a real question on the von of memory , but even if you 're going to have more of that , there 's a real question . why do n't we give that much weight to the weight , that we give films ?
so i want you to think about a thought .
now , imagine your next vor , you know that at the end of the alle , you 're all your images , and you get a medikament drug , so you 're going to remember nothing .
well , would you choose the same wählen ?
and if you 'd choose one else , there are a conflict between your two species , and you 've got to think about how to choose this conflict and that 's actually not obvious , because if you think of time in the sense of time , you get an answer . and if you think of memory in the sense of memory , you might have a different answer .
so why we choose the aussuchen that we consume is a problem that makes us a choice between the two species of self .
well , the two species of self just take two samples of happiness .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can use one per self .
so you can ask , how happy is the selbst self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the selbst ?
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be optimistic ?
and , by the way , we now have a pretty good idea of getting away from the happiness of the selbst self .
and if you ask the happiness of the selbst self , it 's a very different thing .
this is not how happy a person lives .
it 's a matter of how creativity is the person when the person thinks about their life .
very different response .
anybody who 's not different will be different to explore the study of happiness , and i 'm standing to a lot of scientists who have the study of happiness long for these kinds of years .
the distinction between the happiness of the selbst self and the happiness of the selbst itself is in the last few years , and now you 're trying to measure the two zu .
the organization organization has a global survey in which there are more than a million people questions about what they 're thinking about their lives , and they have about their experiences and there was other attempts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn the happiness of the two species of self .
and the real lesson we believe , i think , is that they 're really different .
you can know how excited someone is in his life , and they do n't really know much about how happy he would live his life and the other .
just to put you a sense of gravity that 's burning by a . .
what that means is , if you were meeting somebody , and you would say to you , `` oh , his father 's a , , how much would you know about the size ?
well , you 'd know something about your scale , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much of it .
if i tell you that someone 's got their own life as eight on a scale of 10 hat , they have a lot of reference about how happy it is with its selbst self .
so antarctica is small .
we know something about what the happiness looks like .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is common to be happy with people that we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other news , but that 's unfair .
so if you want to apply the happiness of the two kinds of self , they 're going to do very different things .
the implication of what i 've said about is that we 're not going to be lucky than an extension for well-being .
it 's a completely different concept .
now , very quickly , a different reason we can not think about happiness is that we do n't care about the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california do n't get the right answer .
if you ask that question , you think people need to be more likely to california than you say , we 're in charge life .
and what 's happening is that if you think of life in california , think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in the climate .
well it turns out that climate change is not very important for the selbst self , and it 's not even very important for itself itself , as happy people are .
but now , because the present self is responsible , they can be at the end -- some people could move to california .
and it 's kind of interesting to see what happens to people that go to california in hope .
well , your selbst self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you will think that they 're happier , because if you think about it , you will remember how terrible the weather was in charge , and they will feel you have the right decision .
it 's very hard to think of well-being , and i hope i have one sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
well , when we had a couple of weeks ago , it gave me that there was a pretty interesting outcome coming out of this umfrage survey .
is this something that you can let us , because you 've got a few minutes now ?
daniel : : sure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the umfrage survey is a number that we absolutely did n't have to find .
we found this in terms of happiness .
and when we look at the beginning , the feelings of income in the income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 1950 , but it 's a great achievement , under average dollars a year .
65 .
ev : 65 .
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they 're increasingly less and they 'll get more .
that 's where we get absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've just seen flat lines .
what happens is it 's obvious that money does n't give a beschafft , but that lack of money is safe with the money of a beschafft , and we can also measure that very , very clearly .
in the sense of other self , the selbst self , they get another story .
you know , the more money you have to have is to put it up .
it 's not for emotion .
but ultimately , in the entire american cycle , it goes to life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
and if people would take that leadership seriously , i mean , it seems to be all in the head , all of what we believe , for example , in terms of peace and so forth .
is there a chance that politicians , that country will make a difference like the serious , and make it on politics ?
ep : you know , i believe that there are too significant for the role of in in politics .
it 's going to be slow into the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it 's happening right now , and in other countries it 's happening .
people are going to think that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it 's going to take a while , and people will have challenges whether they want to study erforschen , or whether they want to study it , so we need to have the discussion quite soon .
so , as you can get to happiness , it 's very different from how you think and whether it 's going to think of your own self or whether you think of the selbst self .
that will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you have to measure the der of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades of national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this subject , or should be at least the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thanks for the invention of economics .
thank you , scott . .
i 'm mcgonigal . i make video games .
i 've been thinking about 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as it is to save in zu .
i have a plan for this . i want more people to give you all to spend more time with play more and more powerful games .
currently , we spend three billion hours a week in a week .
some of you might think , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we need in the real world .
but actually , my research at the center for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not enough to solve the needs problems of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we want to reduce this time .
i promise that the needed time in 21 billion hours is a week .
so this seems something like this . so what i 'm going to do is -- if we can make problems like hunger , climate change , global conflicts and obesity change , i think we need to try and play online for at least 21 billion hours a week to play the next decade .
no , i 'm really serious .
why ? this image is quite exactly why i believe games are so fundamental for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a des toledano . .
he wanted to find the sound at play . so he 's got a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic desire in play .
if you 're not a player , you may have some of the in in this picture .
and you probably see this sense of urgency , something that 's physical , but also some of the ways that you see in the developing world is a really difficult problem .
if you play too , you look at a number of hier here , which are und in the eyes , and the mouth are a series of ideas .
this is a hot player on the edge of a so-called sieges steht .
oh , you know that . ok . ok . so we have a few player here .
a sieg sign is a result that is so good that it did n't even know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , they 're shocked that they actually are able to be something like this . this is a
this player is just before a sieg .
and this is what we 've got to see in millions of thousands of auf on the world , if we 're going to take the des of the next century into the next century , and the face of it is that we are at the face of a sieges of a sieges .
well , unfortunately , we see more of this face in real life when we look at severe problems .
i 'm like , `` in life i am bad , and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that 's me , as i 'm in life , i am bad .
this is a prototype in my former district home in berkeley , california , where i was in my career , i 'm better in games than in real life .
that 's a problem that many players have .
we think we 're not as good as we are in games .
and i do n't just mean less , even though this belongs .
we do more . i mean good in relation to the motivation , to do something unusual , inspired by collaboration .
if we 're in a sind , i think a lot of us will turn into our best version , the time and immediately sind the problem of the problem as long as it takes for a erneut .
and in reality , if we fail , when we get into account , we feel often differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel ourselves , you know , we feel ourselves , you know , maybe depressed , you do n't know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
these feelings we 've never seen when we play games , they just do n't .
and that 's what i was trying to study as a doctor .
why is it impossible to think , you could n't do anything ?
how can we overcome these emotions in the reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment for problemlösen global problem .
and i 've found some things to do this kind of thing that 's going to be like ,
so , first of all , if you 're living in one of these games , especially in world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters that are willing to give you a mission mission , and it immediately immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission , the perfect to its current level of the game , right ?
so do this .
they never get a task that they ca n't solve .
but always at the top of your skills , so you have to do it again . but there are no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you 're not there . you 're däumchen . there 's always way to do something important .
and there are hundreds of staff .
and where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them , to meet their original mission .
we do n't really know that in real life , this feeling that you have to have in a haufenweise parking staff .
and also , there 's this original story , which is why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you 've heard about `` on the ground up '' and `` spanish '' is `` spanish intelligence . ''
the perfect feedback does n't exist in real life .
when i leave this stage , i do n't have to talk to me , and spanish crazy , verrückte crazy idea .
i do n't get the feedback in real life .
so , the problem with wie like world of warcraft is that it 's so terrifying to stand at the edge of a sieges zu , that we have to spend our whole time into these verbringen .
they 're just better than reality .
up until today , all of the world have spent millionen million years ago to solve virtual problems of zu .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
perhaps bad .
but to see it in context , a millionen million years ago started to get our first aufrecht .
so the first hadron collider collider .
ok , so when we talk about it , how much time we spend working with play games , it only makes sense when you start in terms of the scale of human development .
but also , it turns out that by making this all of the time we use games , actually change what we 're able to do as people in that .
we 're developing to denkenden , wesen creatures .
that 's the truth . that 's what i believe .
if you look at this interesting statistics , which was published by a researcher of british university , the average young man in a country with large verbringt , for 10,000 hours , for 10,000 hours of the 21st century .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , stunden hours are the most popular , that you spend in school , from five to class to the end of high school .
so , we 've got a complete set of research on the face of the young people to learn what it means to be a good player , like anything else to learn in school .
and maybe some of you have this new book of spanish , , `` '' . ''
so you know the theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great research of , that if we spend 10,000 hours , we 'll spend a single subject to the 21st issue until the 21st century , we will be in darin .
we 're going to be so good at what the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are sind .
so the big question is , `` what exactly are hot brilliant ? ''
because if we could figure that out , we would never have menschliches human potential .
so many people we 've seen in the world , at least one hour per day .
these are our . , 500 million people who are relatively good at `` something . ''
and in the next decade we have another billion players who are extraordinary good in whatever they are .
if you do n't have it yet .
the entwickelt developed , , the power of energy and the arbeiten work , rather than the , , the players in the world , especially in india and china , brazil .
you expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have 60 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what we 're doing is making these games .
here are the four things that i found . it 's first .
ok , put it like selbstmotivierung vor .
ist is the desire to do something , and believe that we have a hoffnung hope for success .
players always believe that a sieg of life is possible , and it 's worth to try to try and it 's a matter .
players do n't sit around .
players are im of social networks .
there 's a lot of interesting research that i 'm showing you , after we 've played to them , even if they have failed .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
and we trust that there is a time that someone talked to us that the rules will be werden , that we have the same goal and to stay forward .
so this is how material is growing , and it allows us to do it .
as a result of this , we build complex social relationships .
produktivität ford . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the of of 22 22 hours is playing a week as a . .
the reason is that if we play , we actually are happy to work hard than if we do n't .
we know that we 're working as human beings , if we 're hard , grand work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , with some objective .
so you love , you love , to become part of multiple missionen miles of scale .
this is a , , to put it into the right light , and you know , all the wikipedia , the world 's greatest der in the world .
the second der in the world , with nearly 85 , is the world of warcraft . .
five million people using a month .
they 're more information about world of warcraft in the internet than some of the other issue in any other parts of the world .
they create an urban story .
they create an urban source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four protocells that lead to a single outcome . players are , , dogs individuals .
it 's people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is they think they can change virtual worlds , but not the real .
that 's the problem i try to solve .
c ist is a . .
his work is extraordinary . it studies why people spend so much time , energy and money .
and he says , `` we 're going to do not less than a in in virtual worlds and . . ''
and that 's from an economist . so he 's kind of sense .
and he 's saying ...
not as i 'm -- i think i think playing games , and i 'm a little . .
so he says it really makes sense , because players can reach more than in real life .
they can be used in play social circuits than they are in real life . they get more and more and cheaper in games than in real life .
so , he says it 's completely clear that players spend more time in virtual world than in the real real way .
i just voice . that 's bizarre .
but it 's definitely not a . .
we need to begin to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from this event , the jahre .
you have these ancient , out of . . you know ?
these fantastic gab came up .
and these were the first of people developed . .
and if you 're familiar with the work of old cold herodotus , you may know that story , the history of how and why games have been invented .
according to wurden , more , , more , , in the sun during a erfunden .
well , there was such a huge word that the king of sich gave up to a crazy idea .
people were . . people were fighting .
it was a real situation . you needed a wonderful solution .
so they invented , herodotus , , the und and eine a national strategy .
and they would be so much in the vertieft process that games are so fascinating and with , , produktivität productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to überlebten , they survive for 18 years , and they ate on one day and playing the next day .
in the same way , i think we can put a games .
we put games to . the suffering of the real world .
we put games to , everything that works in the real world does n't work , and we all get what we need from play .
but it does n't have to be the end .
that 's the exciting thing .
according to wurde , for 18 years , did not better , so the king decided to be a last anzusetzen .
they shared the glass in two .
they played a und , and the tumor was able to build a abenteuer of adventure .
they left und , and they went for looking for a new home , and they had so many people back to survive , how they went to survive , and they went to the rest after a neighborhood in which they could grow .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but ted zeigen show that the , , the later of the reich empire , the same dna as the old aufweisen .
and so scientists came back to the evidence that ' ' film was actually right .
and apparently , the evidence of a global , that took almost 20 years of what was going to explain .
so the crazy story could be clear .
maybe they actually got their people through games by 18 years and have 18 years in games , and then they had these hatten , and so much more about them play so much about having their civilization .
so we can also .
and we 've been doing it for watson .
this was the first in in real world in the world of . . this was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years for five years , we 've been trained by 16 years .
i 'm going to argue to you for our own spiel play .
so , they got half of their civilization for a new world , which is why i 'm going to get my 21 billion pro per week .
we should be optimistic that half of us has spent an hour a day with play until we 've solved the problems of real world .
i know you 're going to ask me , `` how do we solve the real world in games ? '' and exactly that question , i have my work in the center for the future .
we have this budget in our office in amsterdam , and it suggests how we should understand the future .
we do n't want to try the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to introduce the best result , and then people do , , this idea in the reality .
we give ourselves the sun and give people to achieve them .
i 'm going to show you a quick bit of three games that i designed to try and try to give people out of the sun in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a , , where you have to press a überwinden .
the ist is invented , but we 've got enough , of it for them to be used for them , and they 're actually sie their real life without oil . so , if you turn in a game , they 're actually going to get out of where they live . and then you get in in real time that they 're looking at how much oil is not there , like food is ist , which is , in fact , what they 're not going to do is to create schools , if they 're gibt , and you 've got to figure out how to design your real life when it would be , and we ask you to break about them , videos or images .
we 've tested this game with spielern players in 2007 , and we 've taken them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a fundamental experience .
nobody wants to change life because it 's good for the environment or because we should .
but if you 're in a abenteuer adventure and said , `` we 're the oil . ''
that 's a fascinating adventure where you go .
you find out how to survive , most of our players have to continue with the game in the game .
so we have a bigger play in the next stage of a bigger , higher goal than just . .
we developed the game `` '' '' for the future for the future .
and as a result of fact , it 's an indication that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this mushroom is called global sensibilisierungs-system '' , of course .
the call to players , they have almost the `` '' '' gestaltet .
you know bruckheimer-filme , , where it 's '' . you have the program , the scientists and the only way you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , say , everybody 's in business , and it 's our task to create the future for energy , food , health , security and future of social justice .
4,000 players played this game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredible concrete solutions that they can read if they were . .
and the last thing we bring is the three . it 's a game in collaboration .
if you leave that game , you 'll get from the world 's `` , the social '' .
we 're working with universities all over us , and we 've managed to learn social content .
we have a name . we 've got to go up with verstehen , nachhaltigkeit , sustainability , vision and glue .
i 'd like to share all of you to share this game with young people everywhere in the world , especially in , , who are allowed to imagine their own social plan in order to save the world .
i come to the end .
let me ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we 've got all these fantastic players , we 've got games that show us what we can do , but we do n't have to survive the real world .
well , i hope you agree with me , that players are human resources that we can use in real life , and games have a great meaning for change .
we 've got these whole protocells , produktivität ford , the ability to create highly social networks to form , und , and the desire for the bedeutung .
i really hope that we play together with great games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope that they will design and play with this .
if i go to the next decade , i 'm sure that we can create any zukunft future , and that we can play all kinds of play games .
so i say , let 's start in games !
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you a little bit about what happened to me a few months ago , a couple of months ago , a few months ago .
i have always writing my griffbereit license , but i was finished with the des of schon , and i realized that i 've never had in my life in my life , which is the word `` uncertainty . ''
i read you the vor .
`` uncertainty , '' : , nutzlos , zerstört , abgestorben , verwundet , verwundet , verwundet , verwundet , verwundet , verwahrlost , verwahrlost , verwahrlost , verwahrlost , verwahrlost , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , gehandicapt , dem , kaputt aus , kaputt ausgezählt , auch ausgezählt , auch siehe , trust and weak .
: : healthy , strong , powerful . ''
i 've read the list of my friend to read the laughter , and i had to laugh , and it was so ridiculous , but i was only going to get out of it and i did n't know what to read , and i had to go to read , and then i had to go to the wortflut of the wortflut , and i had to go through this wortflut of emotional ink .
of course , that was a , , old . . i just thought that the steps must be quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early '80s , when i was working on the early '80s , and i started looking at my legacy outside of my family science building , and forms of children in terms of children around the world around me .
and thank god i did n't use a benutzt .
if i was to take this to seriously , i would be in a world that someone would like me to be able to figure out their lives in a weise way , but now i 'm going to show you the opportunity of the opportunity that i 've experienced .
so i immediately suggested the von of 2009 in 2009 , and i expect you to find a beitrag of it .
here 's the version version of the . version .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
in particular , the last two words are in `` close '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just words .
it 's what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it 's about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language changes our thinking and how we can see the world and the people around us .
now , a lot of gesellschaften societies , including the army and the literature , have really believed that the sounds of a eine is a great force because that 's what you 're looking for , you can also kann .
so , what do we actually do ? a menschen people or a powerful people ?
in fact , a human being used to call it as a child , they could pay , they commit and ideas .
would n't it be nice to open the doors ?
one person who 's open for me is my head on the . floor .
he 's called dr. . . it 's a , , whose name , as you can think , most americans do n't respond properly , so it 's always called dr. .
and dr. pierpont has always moved very thick , and it was just working with kids like this .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until i was in the hospital .
i had to have a übungen , very difficult , with these , , with these , , bändern -- -- in different colors -- that 's what you 're going to do in my aufzubauen building , and i 've seen this stage more than anything else . i put it up . i got it . i got it .
and just imagine , i 've even had a kind kid with dr. collaborators , and trying to stop this exercise , ohne without success .
and one day , he was looking at me with one of my practice -- these skills were just und and -- -- and he said to me , `` wow , du , you 're so strong and young girls , you 're going to have one of these zerreißen .
and if you get it , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
that was , of course , only a slightly exciting insight of dr. hawking , so i do n't want to do the practice that i did n't want to do , with the way that sign was 45 girls in the im room in the second floor , but he was actually brought to see my daily mit in with new eyes , so it became a new and erlebnis experience .
and i wonder how much his vision of mine is being strong and junges young girls , and i could imagine me as one of nature from strong , powerful and mensch .
this is just an example of a lot , as adults at die have to do this kind of child .
but what they 've already been doing is , what they 've done is that they do n't want to have a , view of our language to imagine something that we would all want to give them all the individual , to see ourselves as powerful people .
our language den the social changes that we 've been introduced through a technological change .
and of course , the medical view of view , of course , is that my legs , the für of , , aus from malnutrition and artificial für for körper bodies that allows people to actually use their opportunities , they 're not going to have their capacity to go out , they 're not too talking about social plattformen , and people can define their identity , they 're in their own ways , and they have to , the world on the world .
so , maybe this technology 's technological change , because the fact that it has always been another truth , which is that every human one of the society can be something different and very sustainable , and that the human ability is that our greatest culture .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story because people ask me to tell me about how i deal with business , and i 'm going to give you something a little bit about : this sentence has never und me , and i 've always been able to answer the questions of people 's questions , and i think , i understand why .
this sentence from mit lives , which is that success or happiness is about to become a challenge , without having to be able to get any experience of what 's going to be so successful -- as if my life was so successful , because i could paint the way of a life with a warm , or whatever it is for me to understand with my illness .
but the truth is that we change ourselves , and of course , we are from the challenge of the challenge , whether it 's physical , emotional , even both .
and i argue that 's good .
leadership is not a , that we have to have to be able to make our lives better .
conservation conditions are just alive .
and i tend to see anger as my shadow .
sometimes i realize it 's true , sometimes he ca n't see it , but he 's always at me .
and i want enough to be the effect of the impact of another people .
there are microbes in life and challenges , and these are just real real , and every person goes differently . but the question is not whether or not whether or not we 're honest or is not , but how do you get that ?
so we 're not just responsible for people who we love to keep zu , but they 're asking to get good at this .
and we do n't care our kids , if we give them feel that they can not adapt .
you 've got to give two things clear : to give you the medical truth , you need to be able to be able to be able to do something that i 'm doing , or not .
and to be honest , the only real hand and to be free , which i had to ask me apart , that the world is constantly likely to describe me with these beschreiben .
in our desire to protect people who are on the heart , and to give them the cool , hard truth about their medical insights , or even a sense of life that they would expect , we need to be able to make sure that it 's not the case that someone actually is .
maybe this is a piece of concept that 's only focused on what 's going on in a box , and how we fix it , for each individual as a larger weapon than the an .
if we do n't trust people who are not familiar , and not all its forces and our opportunities and touch , we create the natural struggle that they might have to have a more disease .
we einen a man who has an value for our society .
so we have to focus beyond the hinaus , and we have to focus on all the area of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it 's between perception of our mind and our great habits , a connection .
we do n't want to be able to do this kind of zeiten or , , we should not try to avoid it , and it 's about it under the carpet , but it 's about to see in terms of humanity .
it may seem to be clear to ask us that we do n't need to overcome business , but that we 're open to um them to be able to actually use a zu and maybe dance .
and perhaps we make it to be connected as something natural , awkward and useful and feel like that , by the way , it 's not so stupid .
in this year , we collect 200 darwin , and as he wrote about 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , very real in human nature .
what i would like to do is : this : not the most powerful of the species , and it 's not the seiner of its way , but that they can change changes in the best .
in conflict , creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability to survive is to survive and , , from the fight of human mind is to turn through conflict .
so , again , change and sind are the great skills of people .
and perhaps we know from what is powerful , if we really get werden .
it may be the sense of anger , a sense of something , a sense for our own power .
we can do something else .
we can give refrigeration a new meaning that goes on very difficult time .
maybe we can see cooperation as change .
leadership is a change we have n't yet yet .
i think the biggest way we 've got ourselves ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
in fact , who is normal ?
there is no normal thing .
you have the usual . the typical thing . it 's not the normal thing . and would you really know the poor person if it was you ?
i do n't think so .
it would be great if we could have this paradigm of rich versus a different of the possibilities , or the strength for it to even be a little bit dangerous , könnten , so we can , the forces of very much of children , and they were willing to . the forces of these special and valuable skills in society .
so what they found out is that , in fact , we have people in our society of our society : useful to being useful and to do it .
there are evidence that , in fact , neandertaler people have older people and people with severe physical benefits , and that 's what happened to them , because the bacteria in the center of these people was critical to society .
they do n't have these people who go out of them as well as something special and value .
a few years ago , i was in the city where i grew up in a in room in the winter of pennsylvania , and i was in a tomaten library .
it was summer and i was an .
and i hear what a guy behind me says , `` well , if this is n't mullins ist . ''
and i looked around and see this old man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` well , sir , know what ? i ca n't remember you . ''
and he said , `` well , you can hardly remember me .
when i first saw her for the first time , i made her out of her mother .
oh , the .
and of course , then , it 's gemacht .
this was dr. , , a man who i had only known from stories of my mother about this day because i was , of course , from my birthday two weeks .
the doctor 's physician , diagnostik , my mother was in berkeley , and so my parents knew the man who brought me in the world at all .
and because i was born without geboren , and my feet came after them , and i was just a few shots at this one and a few shots at the other foot , and he was the , who had to hold the bad news .
and he said to me , `` i had to tell her parents that you would never walk , and never be so ill like other kids , or you 've never had an ideal life , and then they 've just got me out . ''
really extraordinary was the fact that he did hat my whole childhood in the second class , whether i was in a in in the second class , whether i was in a in in the zu of klasse , whether i had to go to the bei of the zu zu , in whether i had my master or one of my siege errungen hatte , and he used this , to teach his students to help aus from medical medical school and the medical medical school .
and he called this part of his den the x factor , the potential of the human being .
you ca n't be able to get enough , how critical this object can be for the quality of people .
and dr. erzählte at night , he said , `` i learned that kids , if they do n't always know anything else , and even though they get a little support , if you put children else , then children can do much . ''
see , dr. hat has changed .
he understood that the medical self , and as anyone act , two different things .
and also , i 've changed , over the course of time , if you had to have asked me in the age of 15 years , if i was in the age of 15 years , if i was in the age of aus and bones , i would have no second . .
i was very successful at all .
if you ask me today , i 'm not that sure .
and that 's happened because i experienced something with my legs and not though of this experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i am being fascinated so many people who are open to me , rather than people who would give me an idea or me .
you see , it really needs to do one people who show you how they know their forces , and they 're through .
if you allow them to , your own , deep forces -- the human spirit is so – -- if you can , and for someone in a critical moment , a door is open , and they 're a very good teacher .
they bring them to open the doors .
the real meaning of the word `` '' '' is `` '' '' in the word `` '' . ''
it means something that is in one that 's the potential .
again , what is the potential to tell us now ?
in the '60s , in britain they had a durchgeführt in britain .
they call this `` trials '' '' in the united states we call the `` '' . ''
students are . .
and the one students will be , harder , the better teachers , and
they then got over a zeitraum period of mit students with a number of good , the phrase `` very good . '' it was told them that they were , , that they were very smart . and after these three months they really wrote geschrieben .
and of course , it would hear the heart of the heart , which is , in fact , it was n't enough .
and so it was also the three months .
but only those who are still in school -- despite the students who had been raped in school .
most importantly in this study was the teachers were not waren .
the teachers did n't know that something was going to happen .
they 've just been told that they 're the und and that they are the students who are in the class , and they have a little bit of them and they consume them .
the only real collider is a geist spirit that 's broken , no hope has more ; it does n't find any more beautiful . it lack of our natural , neugier curiosity , and our moral ability to imagination .
but if we can create the human mind to help the human mind , to hope and find other people around it , curious and zu , we put our forces really more important .
if a mind is about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new schaffen .
i 'd like to end with a poem that was made by a poet namens called im in the 17th century , and the poem is called `` the god that only four words knows . '' `` every child knows god , not the god 's god , it 's not the god 's god , it 's not the god 's god , it 's the god 's god , it 's not four words , and it 's all constantly , , he 'll just know : come , dance with me . ''
come on me . thank you .
